Grammars developed within the DELPH-IN framework reflect differing levels of effort and scale, as well as frequency of updates.  The grammars described here are grouped into two broad categories:

(1) Broad-coverage implementations that are actively maintained, including for English (the ERG with a separate home page tab), Norwegian, Mandarin Chinese, and Japanese;

(2) Other grammars which are either currently less active or of more modest scale, including for the languages Bulgarian, German, Greek, Hausa, Hebrew, Indonesian, Korean, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Thai, Vietnamese and Wambaya.

A catalogue providing links to more detailed descriptions of many of these grammars can be found [here](GrammarCatalogue).
