# Overview
If you are trying to use natural language to command and query software of some kind, you will need to "evaluate" or "solve" the MRS against the state of the software in order to answer the question being asked or perform the action being requested. This section describes one approach to doing this by iteratively solving the tree of predications in a [scope-resolved tree](). It effectively uses the [depth-first computational SLD approach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SLD_resolution) that, for example, the Prolog language takes in proving a goal. This approach walks the scope-resolved tree in depth-first order and iteratively finds assignments of variables that make the MRS "true". It uses backtracking to try alternatives when they exist. 

The approach is actually relatively straightforward. This section will walk through how to build a solver using Python to make it concrete.  When finished, you will be able to evaluate MRS trees using a surprisingly small amount of Python code.
