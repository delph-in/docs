All links within a page are broken:
      https://delph-in.github.io/docs/summits/SummitTop/

* Testing removal (what happens if something is removed from the wiki?)
* 404 at root DNS name: https://delph-in.github.io/
* If we are presenting lists of discussions, include dates
* Make a visual difference between internal and external links
* Rename garage (to attic?)
* Test whether you can put links to one thing in two places -- Grammar Matrix Getting Started page now moved to How To, should it also be in Matrix?
* Put the latest sites in a different branch (to separate changes to content from changes to compiled content -- don't want them mixed in the same history). Bot commits end up cluttering up the history.
