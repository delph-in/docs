{% raw %}Discussion of MWEs, inspired by Ann's participation in
[PARSEME](http://www.cost.eu/domains_actions/ict/Actions/IC1207).

We have started a new page on MWEs ([MweTop](https://delph-in.github.io/docs/summits/MweTop)) to which we will
link various relevant things.

## What do we do now

- things with spaces
  - some interfacing with morphology
- things made into a single predicate
  - look up
- things recognized as larger things with idiom matchin
  - determiner-less PPs *in hospital*
    
    - also occurs outside/slightly genericy
    - semi-lexicalized
  - idiom thingies *keep tabs on*
    
    - some work at NTU/CSLI on possessive idioms
    
    \+ note: not marked as a unit in the MRS output + supported by
LKB and ACE
  - different types of idiomaticity detless\_pp vs flexible idioms
  - we have paraphrase rules for many of these
    - but not perfect *out of your tiny mind*
- how does the interface with chart mapping/tokenization
- what about the idiomatic/non-idiomatic distinction
  - we don't enforce it perfectly
- we maybe have more examples of MWEs with structure than anyone else
  - although we don't have as many examples as e.g. in wordnet
- SRG: words with spaces, verb+particle, idioms (take into account)
- Matrix: no idioms (FCB: there is documentation on the wiki)
- [NorSource](/NorSource): not yet
- Burger: some types for verb+complement
- Jacy: all kinds, even documentation
  - not so good with things like te-nakareba-narimasen, complex pps
  - (<http://moin.delph-in.net/JacyIdiom>)
- Hegram: nothing
- MCG: nothing
  - Chengyu (four character idioms)
    - treat them as non-compositional
    - NTU has a list of these with some more information (with
help from Mike and Ning)
    - there are also non-Chengyu idioms
- we can have both internal and external modification (for some
idioms)
  - *the cat kicked all nine buckets* (Mike)
- a lot of regional use
- treat proverbial the same as fucking (can go anywhere)
- in general adding MWEs adds ambiguity so we tend not to add them
  - if they help in parse-selection it would be worth putting them
in
  - even very common things like *Thank you* and *good morning*

## Things we don't have an account for:

- institutionalized phrases *traffic light*/*traffic signal*
- light verbs/light verby idioms *give a rat's arse \[about\]*
- proverbs --- how do we handle these *a stitch in time saves nine*)
  
  - interestingly cross-lingually
  - often contains frozen bits of older grammars
- fixed foreign phrases (que sera sera)
  - interesting to see if there are differences
    - in flexibility between old English vs foreign
- NPIs are on the edge of this phenomenon
- things like *you may wish to* -&gt; *you should* (post-process)
- *If you like* currently words-with-space in ERG

## Other projects

- MWEs with structure in wordnets
- Lots of work in Japan, e.g. on idiom/literal (Chikara)
