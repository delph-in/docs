{% raw %}Emily's understanding of the problem:

German: yesterday you not should have slept

Yesterday: Needs to have an index for its ARG1, and a handle to identify
its LBL with.

Not, should: Underspecify which is higher. Both say their LTOP is geq
their actual LBL (same LTOP).

But: How will yesterday see both events and know which one to take so
that it gets only legitimate event-handle pairs. Want to avoid
multiplying out the possible LTOP/HOOK pairs.

Ann's possible solution:

Not temporarily has its own event as its INDEX (rather than its MOD's
event), and that event is resolved to the event of the thing it actually
modifies (in the resolved scope).
