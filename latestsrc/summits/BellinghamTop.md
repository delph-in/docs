# Overview

The 16th DELPH-IN [Summit](https://delph-in.github.io/docs/summits/SummitTop) will be held in Bellingham,
Washington, from Monday, 13 July, to Friday, 17 July 2020 (the week
after ACL in Seattle). The meeting will take place at the Chrysalis Inn
and Spa in the Fairhaven area of Bellingham.

The Chrysalis is a five minute walk from the downtown Fairhaven area
featuring restaurants and coffee shops in one direction, and a 5-10
minute walk along the waterfront to another nice coffee shop in the
other direction. Several of you have been there. We have the conference
room reserved for the whole week, and they are currently holding 25
guest rooms for arrival on the 12th and departure on the 18th. The venue
is an 18 minute walk (according to Google Maps) from the Fairhaven
railway (Amtrak) and bus depot. Recommendations will follow on the best
ways to get there from the Seattle, WA and Vancouver, Canada airports
(which are about equidistant).
