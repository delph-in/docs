{% raw %}# Overview

The [DELPH-IN](http://www.delph-in.net) Standing Committee proposes to
hold its second internal working meeting, aiming to bring together
developers and active users of DELPH-IN resources to date. The meeting
will be held prior to the [11th Annual conference of the European
Association for Machine Translation](http://eamt.emmtee.net/) (EAMT) at
[Fefor HÃ¸ifjellshotell](http://www.fefor.no/) in Norway. Participants
will meet for five days, between Tuesday, June 12, and Saturday, June
17, 2006.

Based on earlier meeting participation and introspection about DELPH-IN
distribution, the Standing Committee invites researchers from some
twenty five R&D sites to participate in the meeting, and between 30 and
45 individuals are expected to be present for the meeting. An up-to-date
summary of expected participants can be found on the
[ParticipantsGroup](https://delph-in.github.io/docs/summits/ParticipantsGroup) page.

# Aims of the Meeting

The purposes of this meeting are to:

- update each other on recent developments and current activities;
- discuss more what we actually expect from DELPH-IN (and each other);
- create the opportunity for contentful exchange on computational
grammar research in the DELPH-IN spirit

In order to meet these goals, we are breaking the meeting into two
parts: the first half will be organized with in-depth sessions, some
held in parallel. Discussion in these slots will be technical and will
presuppose significant earlier experience with DELPH-IN resources and
software. The second half of the week will be plenary and (likely) more
varied in content: ranging from site and project updates to strategic
and tactical discussion of future activities (and possibly including
tutorial elements).

# Schedule & Materials

The following members of the Standing Committee have volunteered to help
put together the programme for each of the sections:

# Organizational

The [Fefor](http://www.fefor.no/) conference hotel is located in the
Norwegian Mountains about three hours north of Oslo. For travel to and
from Oslo airport, please see the [EAMT](http://eamt.emmtee.net)
conference pages.

We have obtained a preliminary group booking at Fefor at a discounted
rate of NOK 890 per person. This rate includes accommodation in a single
room (with lake view), breakfast, lunch, and dinner, use of the
conference facilities (including wireless internet access), and coffee
breaks during the day. Participants need to register directly with the
hotel (email: <mailto:informasjon@feforhotell.no>) no later than May 1, 2006.
Please mention your participation in the DELPH-IN Summit 2006 and
confirm your arrival and departure dates, room arrangements, and dietary
constraints (if any). At the same time, we will be using the
[ParticipantsGroup](https://delph-in.github.io/docs/summits/ParticipantsGroup) wiki page to keep track of
participants, so please sign yourself up there too.

From Oslo airport (called Gardemoen) there is a direct train connection
to Vinstra, the train station closest to Fefor. From Vinstra, Fefor is
easily reached by taxi (for around NOK 250). Furthermore, we will look
into organizing minibus transfers for select train arrivals and
departures.

|----------|---------------|-------------|
| **Date** | **Gardemoen** | **Vinstra** |
| 12-jun   | 08:33         | 11:12       |
| 12-jun   | 11:05         | 13:59       |
| 12-jun   | 15:24         | 18:00       |
| 12-jun   | 16:33         | 19:12       |
| 12-jun   | 23:46         | 02:55       |
| 15-jun   | 08:33         | 11:12       |
| 15-jun   | 11:05         | 13:59       |

It should be possible to catch a train back to Oslo (or Gardemoen
airport for those not staying for the [EAMT
conference](http://eamt.emmtee.net)) right after completion of the
meeting on Saturday; however, train connections on the following day may
afford greater flexibility.

| **Date** | **Vinstra** | **Gardemoen** | **Oslo S** |
| 17-jun   | 19:45       | 22:14         | 22:42      |
| 18-jun   | 11:54       | 14:43         | 15:13      |
| 18-jun   | 17:38       | 20:14         | 20:42      |
| 18-jun   | 19:45       | 22:14         | 22:42      |

For those having to stay overnight in Oslo prior to their departing
flight, the [Radisson
Gardemoen](http://www.radissonsas.com/servlet/ContentServer?pagename=RadissonSAS/integration/hotelInfo&hotelCode=oslzr)
hotel at the airport may be the most convenient. Using a little more
time to explore Oslo, the [Radisson
Plaza](http://www.radissonsas.com/servlet/ContentServer?pagename=RadissonSAS/integration/hotelInfo&hotelCode=oslzh)
or [Astoria](http://www.thonhotels.no/astoria) hotels are both very
close to the downtain train station. The [airport express
train](http://www.flytoget.no) takes approximately twenty minutes back
to Gardemoen.

Should people want to explore some more of Norway, the
[EAMT](http://eamt.emmtee.net/index.php?page=5#fun) pages have some
suggestions and pointers. Fefor is also quite close to the
[Rondane](http://www.rondane.info/) and
[Dovre](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dovrefjell) mountain ranges for
those who enjoy hiking.

When you're packing, don't forget to bring your \[???, hiking shoes,
insect repellant\] because the hotel has/is close to \[???\]. A local
weather forcast can be found
[here](http://tux.aftenposten.no/weathersearch/weathersearch.do?name=feforvatnet&sok=limnor).

# Results

The wiki has been populated (and should continue to be populated) with
the results of many of the discussions and the slides from the talks.
