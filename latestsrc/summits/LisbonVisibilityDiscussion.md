### Discussion

V Kordoni:\
website update, who should do it? Up to now, Stephan (publications list,
resources and grammars, migration of pages, etc.)\
How to reduce load on one person?

S Oepen:\
Credits: Hans and DKFI web design staff.\
move more content into wiki? but formatting limitations, esthetic and
content

V Kordoni:\
very useful (for funding applications) to have a grammar listed on
official DELPH-IN site and not on personal page.

S Drellishak:\
up to now we are not using very complex content (dynamic html etc.) so
wiki is realistic

F Bond:\
make stable top, external pages as pretty as possible, but inside
content can be wiki

A Frank:\
what should be visible to whom? documentation of tools for example\
but decide first what should be there and then figure out how to get it
there

B Crysmann:\
visibility in CL community, collocation with HPSG or with other events?

M Siegel:\
publications, would rather contribute her references directly instead of
going through a webmaster

F Xu:\
existing user-driven bibliographic database tools, e.g. in use at DFKI

S Oepen:\
no need for comprehensive database, just up to date representative
sample

D Flickinger:\
self-selected publications list could be part of externally visible
site-specific descriptions part of wiki

F Fouvry:\
aside from our website, make sure to have links on related pages (work
using DELPH-IN tools)

D Flickinger:\
make a habit of inserting DELPH-IN into presentations, logo on slides,
etc. (i.e. not only in published work)\
Maybe standardize practice?

A Frank:\
and personal web pages

V Kordoni:\
would be useful to get feedback from DELPH-IN, a committee who could
look at tutorial slides, coaching

S Oepen:\
recent paper for MT summit workshop, marketed forcefully as a DELPH-IN
result

traffic.delph-in.net statistics, try to get your institution into the
top ten!

propose possibility of hosting resource pages under delph-in domain
(hosted non-locally, with redirection)

hosting mailing lists, Developers' list currently most active

F Fouvry:\
each site hosts and maintains a part of the website according to its
expertise, then redirected

A Frank:\
multilingual aspect should be much more prominent\
clearer mission/vision so people who are attracted to the site remain
interested as they browse the content

D Flickinger:\
users of tools/resources should make themselves known (in site-specific
pages) so developers know what people need, who depends on what
functionalities\
developers: give an idea of upcoming developments on tools/resources
pages
