Note that Friday and Saturday are public holidays in Czechia: [Saints Cyril and Methodius Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyril_and_Methodius) and [Jan Huss day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Hus).  These celebrate, among other things, the creation of the Glagolitic alphabet (the ancestor of Cyrillic) and the orthographic reform of writing a diacritic to replace a digraph (*cz* to *č*: by Huss in his De Orthographia Bohemica (1412)).
