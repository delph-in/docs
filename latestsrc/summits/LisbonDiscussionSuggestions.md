{% raw %}Here are the original ideas for discussion topics as suggested by
participants through 7/8/05.

Based on the success of the EMELD conferences at getting interesting
work done during scheduled small group discussions, I suggest that some
of the time (perhaps in larger increments) be used for organized
discussion. Depending on the size of the group, we may wish to break up
into slightly smaller crowds. Possible discussion topics, unordered,
spanning both general and specific (though I think that the more
specific we can be, the more useful the discussion is likely to be)...

- Specific steps we as DELPH-IN can take to
  - ... improve collaboration
  - ... raise the stature of robust, deep processing in the NLP
community
  - ... become visible as an organization
- Which applications benefit most from deep processing?
- What research avenues are interesting but presently closed for lack
of relevant technology?

And now some further topics suggested by participants:

- Questions on use of latest Matrix
- Further developments in RMRS
- Getting generation to work
- Recent developments and ideas in the Grammar Matrix
- Current developments in statistical modeling (primarily parse
selection): particularly refining or retraining models for
applications in specific domains
- Integration of symbolic and stochastic processing: Prase selection
(integretation into both development and runtime systems), possible
ways of integrating statistical scope resolution and resolution of
modifier attachment (MRS-based), weighting of transfer rules
(MRS-based MT), realization-banking/selection in generation.
- Integration of deep and shallow grammars
- DELPH-IN tools and morphology/phonology
- How to approach potential future participants of DELPH-IN: Should
we? To what extent? Under which criteria?
- Development of DELPHIN repository (systems, tools, data, lingware)
- Comparative evaluation
- Multilingual applications, including MT
- Prospects for joint projects
- Partnerships, membership and outreach
- Visibility, joint PR, presence at international events
- DELPH-IN web site
- Future development of deep processing software: licence issues, new
features, extension of existing tools
- Documentation of grammars and tools: Efficient ways and standard
tests
- Strategies for coverage, new domains, lexical acquisition,
robustness and evaluation
- Propogation of our ideas: usage of DELPH-IN, teaching, publication
efforts
- Joined work and possible project ideas
- Open source licenses: a common DELPH-IN standard?
- Generation from RMRS (what's planned, what's available)
- Matrix updates: What would the community like to see? What makes it
feasible to integrate new Matrix versions? What kinds of community
input to Matrix development are likely to be most effective?
- Delph-In infrastructures
- Parallel grammars and MT
