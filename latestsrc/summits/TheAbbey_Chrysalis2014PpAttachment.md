{% raw %}Regarding trying underspecify PP attachment:

oe: Only PPs in VPs can be a directional complement. Once an adjunct is
there, then any following PP can't be a directional complement. =&gt;
supports the analysis of directional PPs as complements.

- *I threw the boxes into the basement in the summer house.*
- *I threw the boxes in the basement into the summer house.*
- *I threw the model road into Rome into the basement.*

Dan: *I threw those boxes already last Thursday into the basement.* :
can get the interleaving, but it's intonationally marked.

oe: Might be able to recognize which adjuncts can do that.

- *He slipped quietly into the room.*
- ?*He slipped on tiptoes into the room.*
- ??*He slipped on Tuesday into the most heavily guarded room in the
palace.*
- *He slipped quietly into the most heavily guarded room in the
palace.*

Woodley: Any more marked than *the blue big dog barked*

Dan: I don't think we're doing science anymore if we're talking about
degrees of markedness and strangeness.

oe: Main point of these examples is that they are interactions where the
syntax constrains the range of interpretations; one of the things we put
on the design principles.

**Interface representation should include all information that is
constrained by the grammar**

Woodley: You were hinting at another design principle a few minutes ago
â€¦ but not remembering it now.
