## Getting around Amsterdam

Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam is conveniently located walking distance from Amsterdam's Zuid (South) station -- [VU on Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/JQQ6gRn7Jm1D4LFu7). This is the second busiest station, in the middle of Amsterdam's Business District. It is also very well connected with other public transportation.

The following subway/tram lines will bring you directly to Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam: <br>\
Metro lines: [50](https://www.gvb.nl/reisinformatie/lijn/GVB/50), [51](https://www.gvb.nl/reisinformatie/lijn/GVB/51), [52](https://www.gvb.nl/reisinformatie/lijn/GVB/52) <br>
Tram lines: [5](https://www.gvb.nl/reisinformatie/lijn/GVB/5), [24](https://www.gvb.nl/reisinformatie/lijn/GVB/24)

All public transportation in the Netherlands (trains, subway, trams and buses) allow payment using your **debit card** using a tap-in/tap-out system (pay per distance). This includes virtual/prepaid cards like Wise or Revolut. The option to buy a daily or weekly travel card is also available but tends to be more expensive.

And, of course, if you fancy yourself [cycling like a local](https://www.iamsterdam.com/en/travel-stay/getting-around/cycling-in-amsterdam), there are also many places that offer bike rentals. If you book a room at a hotel, your hotel is likely to be able to help you with that as well.

## Accommodation

Amsterdam is an expensive city to visit. We recommend trying to book your accommodation early, as prices are quite dynamic (and July a popular month for tourism). There are way too many hotels to list. Instead, take a look at [Google's overview](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Hotels/@52.3367544,4.8619832,14z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m8!2m7!5m5!5m4!1s2025-07-07!2i4!4m1!1i1!6e3?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDEyOS4xIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) for hotels around Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam.     

Some tried and tested options for previous visitors include: INNSiDE by Meli√° Amsterdam, Element Amsterdam, Cityden Zuidas.

Untried but overtly marketed as cheaper options include: EasyHotel, The Social Hub Amsterdam West, and The Social Hub Amsterdam City
