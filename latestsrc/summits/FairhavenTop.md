# Overview

The 18th DELPH-IN [Summit](https://delph-in.github.io/docs/summits/SummitTop) was held in Bellingham,
Washington, from Monday, 18 July, to Friday, 22 July 2022 (the week
after NAACL in Seattle). 

Please register at the [2022 participants page](https://delph-in.github.io/docs/summits/Fairhaven2022Participants).  We will do our best to make it a hybrid event, please let us know if you intend to attend locally or virtually, and if so your preferred times (for meeting scheduling).

## Program

The [final program](https://delph-in.github.io/docs/summits/Fairhaven2022Schedule) is up. Monday to Wednesday were plenary talks and discussions, with the excursion on Wednesday afternoon.   SIGs and tutorials were on the final two days.

The program committee this year consists of Luis Morgado da Costa and Francis Bond.

## Location

The meeting will take place at the [Chrysalis Inn
and Spa in the Fairhaven area of Bellingham](https://www.hilton.com/en/hotels/blittqq-the-chrysalis-inn-and-spa-bellingham/). The Chrysalis is
an eight minute walk from the downtown Fairhaven area
featuring restaurants and coffee shops in one direction, and a 12
minute walk along the waterfront to another nice coffee shop in the
other direction.

# Travel

The venue is an 18 minute walk (according to Google Maps) from the Fairhaven
railway (Amtrak) and bus depot.  Prior to COVID, Amtrak service was available to Fairhaven on the line linking Seattle with Vancouver, Canada.  Due to border closings, this line is not currently in operation, but as of February 2022, Amtrak was reportedly preparing to reopen it.  Absent the return of train service and felicitous flight timing, the easiest way to reach Bellingham is by bus.  The [Bellair Airporter Shuttle](https://airporter.com/shuttle/schedules/bellingham-to-seatac/) operates every 2 hours directly from Seattle-Tacoma International Airport to the Four Points Sheraton hotel in Bellingham, from which local city buses, Uber, or Lyft will connect the final couple of miles.  Use caution when checking for transit routes with Google Maps, as it appears to be under the incorrect impression that the Bolt Bus service is still operational.

As Bellingham does have its own local airport, booking a connecting flight may be an option, and some visitors may be able to book a flight directly, but most locations do not have direct flights to Bellingham.  Usually, taking the bus is an easier option.

Historically, flying into Vancouver, Canada has also been a good way to reach Bellingham.  At time of writing, COVID precautions have made it difficult to find transportation from the Vancouver airport to Bellingham, but that could change.

# Accommodations

The Chrysalis (conference venue) is currently holding 8 guest rooms for check-in on the 17th and departure as late as the 23rd, and an additional 8 guest rooms for check-in on the 18th and departure as late as the 23rd.  Reservations can be made on the [Chrysalis website](https://www.hilton.com/en/hotels/blittqq-the-chrysalis-inn-and-spa-bellingham/) using group code DELPH, or over the phone with Chris Caldwell at (360) 392-5558.

Additionally, the [Fairhaven Village Inn](https://www.fairhavenvillageinn.com) is holding a block of 10 somewhat less expensive rooms which can be reserved using group name DELPH-IN by calling (877) 733-1100.  It's unclear whether the group name can be applied effectively through the online reservation system.  The Fairhaven Village Inn is a seven minute walk from the conference venue.

There may also be opportunities for housing through Western Washington University's summer [guest housing program](https://housing.wwu.edu/guest-housing), but at the moment it is unclear due to COVID policies.
