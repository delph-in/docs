{% raw %}Dan presented a plethora of reasons to abandon the EP representation of
illocutionary force as message relations in favor of a represenation as
a feature of events. No one expressed any strong desire to keep them
around, but it was noted that we should make the shift in a coordinated
fashion. Dan has produced a message-free version of the ERG, which will
not be the supported version until Jan 2007. It was suggested that folks
experiment with removing messages from all the grammars (including the
Matrix) over the next six months, with tentative plans to move in a
coordinated fashion to a message-free universe around 1/2007.
