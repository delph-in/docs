{% raw %}Mike: Facilitate contributing to projects they are not developers for.
Good for remain in touch about their developments.

Emily: have more standardized ways of storing the resources, not
necessarily only the bugs.

Mike: Open source is not only about seeing bugs, but also about
contributing. The idea for bug trackers is not only useful for programs,
but also grammars and other resources.

Bart: Maybe it's most useful for larger projects.

Bernd: Many bugs are not reported in the PET bug tracker. Most feedback
is done on a personal basis. If the tracker would be used more
consistently, more bugs might be resolved.

Peter: The account is a problem.

Emily: Centralisation would help.

Stephan: in general, we have been taling about interacting. Would a
better platform help our communication? I feel that we have improved on
this dramatically in the last years. A central system would indeed be
good. There are existing infrastructures, however.

Bart; It only helps if no parallel infrastructures exist.

Bernd/Emily: Notifications in sucha system would be important.

Mike: re-assigning bugs shuld be possible.

Bart: It's not only bugs, but also documentation, code hosting etc. We
should centralise everything.

([Stephan lists all sites, and ways to keep track of
them](https://delph-in.github.io/docs/summits/InfrastructureTop)).

Emily: is positive about a central place.

Francis: OpenIDs!

Stephan: You can also only centralise the account information, but not
the bug trackers. DFKI, Oslo, and Washington will investigate this.
