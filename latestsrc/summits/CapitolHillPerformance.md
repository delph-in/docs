We had a very informative discussion. I have tried to put most of the
information in the new [GrammarPerformance](https://delph-in.github.io/docs/tools/GrammarPerformance) page
(and not recorded it here), but there was a new idea that did not fit
well there.

An idea for a useful tool (maybe part of [TypediffTop](/Type%20Diff)):

Could we parse something, look for edges that appear and are never in a
real sentence, and offer them to the grammarian as places to try to get
rid of. Look at something like the small trees used in the maxent model?
