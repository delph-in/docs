{% raw %}# Immediate Challenges

Notes from [FeforGrammarians](https://delph-in.github.io/docs/summits/FeforGrammarians) sessin on immediate
challenges to grammar development.

- [FeforIndexAccess](https://delph-in.github.io/docs/summits/FeforIndexAccess) - Linguistic phenomena seeming
to require access to indices of saturated arguments (beyond XARG).
- [FeforDeepGrammarRmrsification](https://delph-in.github.io/docs/summits/FeforDeepGrammarRmrsification) -
Linguistic phenomena for which we cannot give well-formed MRSs
compositionally, but can with RMRS (or some intermediate step).
