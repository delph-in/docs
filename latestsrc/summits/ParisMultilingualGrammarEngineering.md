{% raw %}    Grammar development time/effort
      + are developers more open-minded to automatic (at least non-traditional) methods of grammar dev
    
    Bart: A good grammar takes immense amounts of effort
      + by the time the grammar is developed, perhaps our formalism will be deprecated?
      Antske doesn't think it's an issue. MRS is more important than HPSG (maybe)
      + Also, treebanks that are formalism-dependent similarly have limited value
      + Perhaps we need a less specific "standard" for our treebanks, resources
      Francis: but that results in less interesting information
        + DELPH-IN has not pushed the point that depth-of-coverage is useful (compared to breadth)
        + How do we get to high-depth & high-coverage while producing something also useful at intermediate stages

             breadth
      Antske: HPSG treebanks (and MRS) can be converted to other formalisms, so maintains usefulness
    
    Regarding grammar induction
      Yi: more advanced methods can be applied (data-driven)
      Bart: Laurie brought up using robustness rules for error detection, etc. This is data-driven but not necessarily statistical
    
    Discussion of uses of bilingual text:
      Francis: disambiguation (e.g. prepositions, noun-verb in Japanese-English)
            also for improving coverage (e.g. ERG can parse more of a bitext than Jacy, Jacy developer can look at semantics from ERG output, use to inform Jacy development)
    
    Talk about shared resources/standards
     ... about grammar development time being the bottleneck
     ... about the walls of reaching + (in chart above)
     ... about using dependency treebanks to thin trees when treebanking
    
    + Not always about finding funding for grammar development, but a grammar developer
    
    
    Plans for future grammars:
      Francis wants to find a student for Malay
      Yi says Mandarin will be developed at Saarbruecken (perhaps starting at S and climbing to +)
      Tania says the slavic languages will be further expanded (Polish, Russian...)
    
    What are 'goals' of a grammar?
      Of course, one is applications
      One could be learning about/describing grammar (as opposed to just parsing)
