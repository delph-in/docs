## Travel Info

- To Tomar: From Lisbon, you can reach Tomar by train (recommended) or
bus. When you arrive at Lisbon's airport, we recommend you take the
[underground trains](http://www.metrolisboa.pt/eng/), called Metro.
Beware that the Metro is closed between 1am and 6:30 am. Also,
depending on a number of factors, you may need to wait up to 10
minutes for a train. Lisbon's Metro stations are marked with a red M
sign. In this [underground
map](http://www.metrolisboa.pt/wp-content/uploads/DiagramaMetro_06_2013.pdf),
the colored lines are Metro lines. The airport's station is the
Aeroporto station at one of the ends of the red line.
  
  - By train:
    - You want to exit the Metro at the Oriente station, which is
also on the red line (third station after the airport). Here
you need to go upstairs to the train station.
    - As of February 2014, a schedule of the trains is [available
here](http://www.cp.pt/StaticFiles/CP/Imagens/PDF/Passageiros/horarios/regional/lisboa_tomar_lisboa.pdf).
Notice that you'll be departing from the station "Lisboa
Oriente" (second line in those tables). Notice also that the
trains are direct: you do not need to change in
Entroncamento.
    - There are two types of trains you can choose from: Regional
trains and Inter-regional trains. Regional trains are
cheaper, but they serve more stops. You can also take a
high-speed train (called Alfa-pendular) to Entroncamento and
then change there, but this is more expensive.
    - You may want to check [the train company's web
site](http://www.cp.pt/cp/displayPage.do?vgnextoid=87cbd5abe2a74010VgnVCM1000007b01a8c0RCRD&lang=en).
You can find Tomar's train station in the tab "Timetables
and Prices", but not in the tab "NET Ticket", because you
can only buy online tickets for Alfa-pendular (high-speed)
and Intercidades (long-distance) trains, not for Regional
and Inter-regional trains.
  - By bus:
    - The bus station in Lisbon is in the Sete Rios area. The
nearest Metro station is Jardim Zoológico, on the blue line.
From the Airport Metro station, it may take you almost one
hour to reach the Zoo station. If you follow the indications
there you'll reach the bus station (1 or 2 minutes walking),
which is just outside.
    - This is [the bus company's Web
site](http://www.rede-expressos.pt/default.aspx): click the
UK flag below the logo "Rede eXpressos" for the English
version.
    - There are two daily buses from Lisbon to Tomar; they leave
at 3:15pm and 6pm. There are a few more buses that don't
operate every day. Daily buses from Tomar to Lisbon leave at
7am and 10:15am.
- To Hotel dos Templários: The bus station and the train station are
right next to each other. From there to the hotel, it's a 15-minute
walk
