{% raw %}### Introduction

The discussion started with some
[slides](http://www.kecl.ntt.co.jp/icl/mtg/members/bond/pubs/2005-delphin-testing.pdf)
based on ideas from AnnCopestake.

### DELPH-IN Testing Volunteers

The following people agreed to be the offical testers for their
grammars. They are responsible for checking that the grammar performs as
expected with the various software components that it uses, such as the
LKB, the lexical DB, PET and [\[incr
tsdb()\]](http://www.delph-in.net/itsdb). The testers should join the
[developers mailing
list](http://lists.delph-in.net/mailman/listinfo/developers) and will be
asked from time to time to check a new release against a standard
release, using whatever test set is appropriate for their grammar.

| Korean Resource Grammar       | JongBokKim              |

The advantage to each group of having a designated tester is that it
will be much easier to make sure that their grammar is compatible with
current releases of the software. Testers will also gain a deeper
understanding of the formalism and implementation, which in turn should
help grammar development.

Eventually, it would be very useful if one of the testers would take
responsibility for organisation, including ranking bugs by seriousness,
ensuring that a serious bug is being checked and helping to develop test
sets that allow developers to check particular aspects of the software
quickly.
