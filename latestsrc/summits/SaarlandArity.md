Mathieu's question

From the ERG's semi:

    "_about_a_1_rel": ARG0e, ARG1 i, ARG2 h
    "_about_a_1_rel": ARG0e, ARG1 h
    
    "_acceptable_a_for_rel": ARG0 e, ARG1 p, ARG2 i
    "_acceptable_a_for_rel": ARG0 e, ARG1 e
    "_acceptable_a_for_rel": ARG0 e, ARG1 h

How many different predicates are these? (It's important for (D)MRS
comparison, transfer, conversion from DMRS to MRS)

**Ann:** That depends on what you mean by predicate. At some point there
was a discussion between the more logically oriented and others, where
it was pointed out that you can't swap arity and call it the same
predicate. But by that time a lot of that happened in the grammar. They
have to correspond to logically different predicates in probably all
cases. However, in an MRS they are taken to be a naming convention which
is convenient for some reason; use the general get-out clause that MRS
is a description of a set of semantic objects (not really semantics
itself) and therefore you can get away with having only one rel name
there.

Probably the right way of doing it is to treat them all as different ---
invent a naming convention.

**Emily:** If you're referring to the same discussion I remember, I
recall that this was cast in terms of underspecification, but I don't
see it just now.

**oe:** That was at a [sub-group
gathering](https://delph-in.github.io/docs/garage/WeSearch_UnderspecifiedPreds) last year (at Hankø). We said
that our MRSs (as produced by the ERG, say) can be viewed as
descriptions of underspecified representations, i.e. these predicate
symbol are underspecified… (but AlexLascarides was
unfortunately not present at that meeting).
