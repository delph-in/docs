{% raw %}## Minutes of the 2011 DELPH-IN Summit business meeting

Please add and correct as necessary.

- Two resolutions were proposed and passed:
  - "The DELPH-IN consortium wishes to thank the Suquamish tribe for
their hospitality during the 2011 DELPH-IN Summit".
  - "The DELPH-IN consortium wishes to thank the Utilika foundation
for its support during the 2011 DELPH-IN Summit".
- We discussed possible hosts for DELPH-IN 2012, 2013
  - Candidates:
    - Korea NO for 2012 (ACL is already too busy)
    - Europe: Edinburgh, Sofia (Dan to contact), Daghstuhl
      - Some people (e.g. Melbourne) can only get funded if it
is collocated with another event
- DELPH-IN visibility/branding
  - [New web site design](http://www.delph-in.net/2011/www.pdf) for
DELPH-IN based on a wiki. Move at some time after the summer.
Host at Oslo or UW.
  - Try to use a standard phrase in the acknowledgments: *This work
was made possible in part by DELPH-IN resources.* Cite DELPH-IN
with the web site <http://www.delph-in.net>
  - Maybe write a new position paper describing DELPH-IN aimed at
LREC. Standing committee to think about this
  - Come up with a DELPH-IN Manifesto/Mission Statement. Possibly to
be used as boilerplate in grant applications/papers.
StephanOepen to write draft
  - Encourage everyone to remember to properly cite each other.
- Remind scribes to post notes, participants to read over and edit
  - Please add your own notes and check the scribe's output
- Standing Committee composition and history
  - Standing committee made up of founding members, no current plans
to change, could perhaps enlarge it/change it. We are open to
input.
  - The [standing committee members](https://delph-in.github.io/docs/summits/StandingCommitteeGroup) are
listed online

  - Maybe ISI

  - Dan: Maybe make a visible list of who is visiting where.
- ParticipantsGroup/\`participants' list update process
  - Annual update of the list.
- Erasmus Mundus (EU funded exchanges)
  - encourage members to participate. Saarland already a big hub,
    - Melbourne, NTU also joining in
- Additional items suggested by the membership
  - Please submit papers to [PACLIC
2011](http://portal.cohass.ntu.edu.sg/PACLIC25/)
- Shall we set up a shared bibliography?
  - General consensus was that this is hard to do, instead we should
submit to the HPSG bibliography as much as possible
  - People are also encourage to send a note to a mailing list
(developers or participants) when they have a DELPH-IN friendly
paper
- Finished with a round of thanks to the local organizer (Emily), the
program Chairs (Stephan and Francis) and the Utilika Foundation.
