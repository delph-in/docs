{% raw %}# Open Issues in DELPH-IN Technology

There are many issues in processing with DELPH-IN technology that
require serious research to make progress. Some topics have been
discussed multiple times by developers. This page is intended to contain
pointers to such topics. Some topics may be of interest to students as
potential subjects for research. Each topic has an associated contact
person (\`mentor') who will be responsible for helping people who may be
interested in carrying out the research, at least with respect to its
DELPH-IN related aspects. DELPH-IN members supervising students should
check this page regularly as a source of potential student
projects/direct students to this page.

# The role of the mentor

The role of the mentor is not to serve as a thesis supervisor (or
quasi-supervisor), but rather to provide a point of contact into
DELPH-IN concerns and on-going DELPH-IN activities. Mentors (potentially
in collaboration with co-mentors) will create and maintain a page on the
DELPH-IN wiki for each topic they take charge of. That page should
briefly state the nature of the problem and particularly how it relates
to DELPH-IN concerns. Open Issues pages should include pointers to
relevant DELPH-IN research and perhaps one or two pointers into the
general literature, but are not expected to include extensive
bibliographies. Finally, the page should include contact information for
the mentor, who should be willing to discuss the issue with a potential
researcher. Mentors should \`subscribe' to the pages they are in charge
of to monitor them for updates.

# Open Issues in Need of Mentors

\[The following list was developed during the
[FeforOpenIssues](https://delph-in.github.io/docs/summits/FeforOpenIssues) discussion. Additional topics can be
listed here but should also be announced/discussed on
<mailto:participants@delph-in.net>.\]

- Information structure
  - Representation of topic (and focus) in MT experiments
- Word sense disambiguation
- CLIM-free DELPH-IN: multiplatform; graphics package we like that
works across platforms. Need page outlining current obstacles, and
known best practices for future work (e.g., abstracting menus in
some way that will be interpretable by multiple GUIs) List of
demands on the software -- 30GB memory processes but also laptops.
- TDL extension: "strict" types (i.e., the ability to require
resolution to leaf types)
- List operations
- Discontinuous parsing (see [LkbLpconstraints](https://delph-in.github.io/docs/tools/LkbLpconstraints) for
a possible approach)
- Means of turning of subsets of large grammars to facilitate their
initial exploration by new developers
