{% raw %}Dependency MRS (DMRS: Copestake, 2009) is a representation which may be
interconverted with MRSs which are produced by grammars which obey the
MRS algebra (with some wiggle room) and which also obey the
characteristic variable property. More details will be added soon!

In [RmrsDmrsComparison](https://delph-in.github.io/docs/garage/RmrsDmrsComparison) we have a discussion about
the efficient comparison of packed DMRSs.

The XML serialization of an DRMS, produced by PyDelphinTop, is defined in
http://svn.emmtee.net/trunk/lingo/lkb/src/rmrs/dmrs.dtd
