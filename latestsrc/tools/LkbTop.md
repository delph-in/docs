{% raw %}# Overview

The LKB system is a grammar and lexicon development environment for use
with unification-based linguistic formalisms. While not restricted to
HPSG, the LKB implements the DELPH-IN reference formalism of typed
feature structures (jointly with other DELPH-IN software using the same
formalism).

The primary documentation on the LKB is provided by the book
[Implementing Typed Feature Structure
Grammars](http://cslipublications.stanford.edu/site/1575862603.shtml).
Excerpts from the book provide an [tour of the
LKB](http://cslipublications.stanford.edu/pdf/1575862603h.pdf) (although
see [LkbInstallation](https://delph-in.github.io/docs/tools/LkbInstallation) for revised installation
instructions) and the [user
manual](http://cslipublications.stanford.edu/pdf/1575862603usersmanual.pdf).

These pages are intended to provide documentation for aspects of the LKB
not covered by the book, including recent developments. The use of a
wiki forum is intended to enable LKB developers and users alike to
contribute to the available on-line documentation. If you are new to the
wiki paradigm, please first familiarize yourself with the etiquette and
formatting guidelines, then create a wiki user name for yourself,
register on the server, and start editing pages.

Other pages can be found by entering 'Lkb' in the wiki search box.
Please check this site regularly to see the LKB wiki grow. Or, if you
are a knowledgeable LKB user, consider some volunteer work in creating
up-to-date on-line documentation.

# Grammars

Small sample grammars are downloadable as described in
[LkbInstallation](https://delph-in.github.io/docs/tools/LkbInstallation). Larger scale resources which are
freely downloadable include:

- The [Matrix](http://www.delph-in.net/matrix/): a starter kit for
developing HPSG grammars.
- The [English Resource Grammar](http://www.delph-in.net/erg/) (ERG):
a large-scale HPSG of English.
- The [JACY](http://www.delph-in.net/jacy/) grammar: a broad-coverage
HPSG implementation for Japanese.
- The [Modern Greek Resource Grammar](http://www.delph-in.net/mgrg/):
a medium-size grammar of Greek.
