- [AGGREGATION](http://depts.washington.edu/uwcl/aggregation):
2012–2015. UW. Investigating the automatic creation of
Matrix-derived grammars on the basis of collections of interlinear
glossed text. (Funding: NSF Documenting Endangered Languages grant)
- [Deependance](http://deependance.dfki.de): 2012–2014. LT-Lab, DFKI
The aim of this project is to improve existing methodology for
generic deep linguistic analysis, i.e. the syntactic and semantic
analysis needed for many language technology applications. A
dependency grammar model will be developed that extends the
representations of successful data-driven dependency parsing schemes
by additional elements of linguistic and cognitive sophistication
such as a typed feature system, explicit soft constraints, the use
of both semantic and syntactic dependencies and means for
incrementally produced partial results. (Funding: BMBF contract

# Related Activities

This lists some of the many projects with similar goals, it is by no
means a comprehensive list. Projects are listed in alphabetic order.

- The [Attribute Logic Engine
(ALE)](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~gpenn/ale.html), developed by Bob
Carpenter and Gerald Penn since the early 1990s: one of the early
widespread computational tools (based on Prolog) for the
development of typed feature structure grammars and still in active
use in several research efforts.
- The [Algorithms for Linguistic Processing
(ALPINO)](http://odur.let.rug.nl/~vannoord/alp/) project at
Groningen University (The Netherlands): building a development and
processing environment for HPSG implementations, a comprehensive
grammar of Dutch, a dependency treebank (of Dutch newspaper text),
and related technology.
- The [Core Grammar Project
(CoreGram)](http://hpsg.fu-berlin.de/~stefan/Pub/coregram.html) is a
multilingual grammar engineering project that develops HPSG grammars
for several typologically diverse languages that share a common
core. The system is open-source and can be downloaded as a bootable
CD Rom with the grammar development system, the test environment and
grammars for German, Chinese, Danish, Maltese and Persian.
- The [MiLCA project](http://milca.sfs.uni-tuebingen.de/A4), involving
Tübingen (Germany), Ohio State (US), and Toronto (Canada)
Universities, among others: developing an extension to ALE (see
above) as a development environment for HPSG grammars using ‘rich’
constraints and porting the LinGO ERG into this formalism; focusing
on linguistic adequacy more than on processing efficiency.
- The [Natural Language Theory and Technology
(NLTT)](http://www.parc.com/istl/groups/nltt/) group at the Palo
Alto Research Center (PARC) and associated partners: working within
the LFG framework but in several ways similar to DELPH-IN;
developing the XLE grammar development and processing software and,
in the Parallel Grammar ([ParGram](/ParGram)) project, implementing
grammars of several languages; NLTT and [ParGram](/ParGram)
resources are not publicly available, though.
- The [Robust Accurate Statistical Parsing
(RASP)](http://www.cogs.susx.ac.uk/lab/nlp/rasp/) project at
Cambridge and Sussex Universities (UK): integrating and extending
several strands of research on robust statistical parsing and
automated grammar and lexicon induction, in order to develop and
distribute a new, parsing toolkit for English.
