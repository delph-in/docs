## ToDo

- JACY really needs to access the CONTEXT to decide whether to
generate formal or informal versions of words.
- It would be nice to have a feature showing orthographic variation
  - \- maybe this could be done by convention in the predicate
names: block everything with "chasen" in the id-name
