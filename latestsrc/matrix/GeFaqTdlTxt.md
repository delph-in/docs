{% raw %}# Grammar Engineering Frequently Asked Questions

## I've downloaded an updated version of the matrix, but the changes specified in the new matrix.tdl don't seem to be taking effect when I reload the grammar. What's wrong?

Make sure that the new copy you've downloaded is stored inside your
matrix directory (i.e., the parent directory of the lkb directory in
which the script file you're loading is located, cf. the faq on loading
grammars).

Make sure that the new copy you've downloaded is called matrix.tdl and
not matrix.tdl.txt or anything else. Some browsers try to be helpful and
add the .txt extension, even when it is superfluous. You may need to
configure your directory browser to "show extensions" in order to see
what's going on.
