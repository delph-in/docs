{% raw %}# Documentation for the Grammar Matrix Customization Morphology (Morphotactics) Library

# Introduction

This document explains how to fill out the Lexicon page of the Grammar
Matrix Customization questionnaire and presents background information
on the person library of the Grammar Matrix Customization System (Bender
et al., 2002; Bender and Flickinger, 2005; Bender et al., 2010). General
instructions on using the questionnaire can be found
[here](/delph-in/docs/wiki/MatrixDocTop#general-instructions-on-how-to-use-the-questionnaire).

The Morphology page interacts with virtually every library in the
customization system. On the Lexicon page, the user can define various
lexical types. The features and values available to use in the
definition of these lexical types depend on the answers to other parts
of the questionnaire. In addition, the morphotactics library provides
support for defining the ordering of and dependencies between affixes.

# Citing the Morphology Library

The standard citation for the morphology library is Goodman 2012, an
initial version was made and described in [Drellishak
2009](http://depts.washington.edu/uwcl/matrix/sfd/Drellishak%20-%20Widespread%20but%20Not%20Universal.pdf).

# Options

## General

The morphology page morphotactic properties for nouns, verbs,
adjectives, copulas, and determiners can be defined. The library allows
you to define the position of the morphemes and grammatical properties
associated to it. It does not cover morphophonological phenomena.

The general analysis of inflection posits a stem defined on the Lexicon
page, position classes which define a minimal set of affixes, a
hierarchy of lexical rule types which define features, and a collection
of affixes, known as lexical rule instances. Notably, different lexical
rules might have homophonous lexical rule instances.

For each of nouns, verbs, adjectives, copulas, and determiners, users
can define multiple position classes, a hierarchy of lexical rule types
for each position class, and lexical rules instances for each hierarchy.
Different options are available for position classes and lexical rule
types for each part of speech type. See below for details.

When it is more complete, this section should describe the effects
of the various options provided in this library in terms of the
behavior of the grammar. It is also a good place for tips on how to
get the most from the library. \]</span>

# Analyses

- <span class="small">\[ This documentation is under construction.
When it is more complete, this section should describe the analyses
that are implemented as part of this library and/or point to
publications where those analyses are described. \]</span>

# Upcoming Work

When it is more complete, this section should describe any
modifications to or enhancements of this library that are either in
progress or planned. \]</span>
