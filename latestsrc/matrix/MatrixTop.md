# Overview

The LinGO Grammar Matrix is an open-source starter-kit for rapid
prototyping of precision broad-coverage grammars compatible with the
LKB. The Matrix thrives on input from users working on varied languages.
If you're interested, please contact us --- through the mailing list, or
by emailing [Emily Bender](http://faculty.washington.edu/ebender) at
ebender at u dot washington dot edu.

The [Wish List](https://delph-in.github.io/docs/matrix/MatrixWishList) page serves as a forum for relatively
informal exchange among developers and consumers, in addition to the
Matrix mailing list.

There is an excellent
[guide](http://faculty.washington.edu/ebender/papers/userguide.pdf)
available (Flickinger, Dan, Emily M. Bender and Stephan Oepen. 2003.
*MRS in the LinGO Grammar Matrix: A Practical User's Guide*. ms). Some
of it is out of date, but it is still the best single source of
information.
