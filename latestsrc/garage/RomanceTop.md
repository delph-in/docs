{% raw %}Delph-In currently includes implementation efforts for three Romance
languages: Spanish, [French](https://delph-in.github.io/docs/garage/GrenouilleSummary) (European standard
varieties) and [Portuguese](https://delph-in.github.io/docs/garage/DelphinLisbon). This part of the Wiki is
meant to be an active forum for discussion of common problems and
comparison of implemented/implementable solutions.

Contributions from non-Romance developers are also welcome and
appreciated!

elsewhere)
- Uses of [SE](https://delph-in.github.io/docs/garage/RomSe)
- [P+Det contractions](https://delph-in.github.io/docs/garage/RomContract) Also very relevant to [Modern
Greek](https://delph-in.github.io/docs/grammars/MgrgSummary).
