The DELPH-IN documentation is available at: https://delph-in.github.io/docs/. It is designed to be easy to navigate and contains the most current subset of all the historical documentation in the [DELPH-IN Wiki](https://github.com/delph-in/docs/wiki) as well as other sources. Any changes to files it includes from the Wiki will cause the documentation to be regenerated, once a day.

A quick summary of the difference between the DELPH-IN Documentation Site and the DELPH-IN Wiki:

- [The Documentation Site](https://delph-in.github.io/docs/) is curated to have the subset of the Wiki and other sources that is most up-to-date and pertinent to all users. It is designed to be easy to browse and search and is meant to be the "public face" of DELPH-IN. This is where to start if you are new to DELPH-IN. 
- [The DELPH-IN Wiki](https://github.com/delph-in/docs/wiki) is meant to store the history of the DELPH-IN project and maintains topics of all types, many of them historical, some of them out-of-date or unfinished. Articles can be added, removed, edited by anyone with permission. It is the "Filing Cabinet" of DELPH-IN. A good place to find anything you'd like, but not easily searched or browsable.

[DelphinDocsReference.md](DelphinDocsReference.md) describes how the Documentation Site is built from the Wiki source information and how to change the site structure and what is included.  [DocsQuickStart.md](DocsQuickStart.md) distills the instructions down for those who just want to get the job done and not understand the whole system.
