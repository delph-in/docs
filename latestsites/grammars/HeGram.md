{% raw %}## HeGram - an HPSG grammar of Modern Hebrew

HeGram is an HPSG grammar of Modern Hebrew. It both parses and
generates. It includes a small toy lexicon, which is currently being
expanded via a script that generates a lexicon of about 32,000 lexical
entries from the morphological processor of Hebrew ([Itai & Wintner
2008](http://cs.haifa.ac.il/~shuly/publications/lre4h.pdf)).

The grammar is available for download
[here](http://cl.haifa.ac.il/projects/HeGram/index.shtml).

Here is a good introduction to HeGram:
