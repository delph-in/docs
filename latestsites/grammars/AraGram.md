{% raw %}# AraGram - an HPSG grammar of Modern Standard Arabic

AraGram is an HPSG grammar of Modern Standard Arabic. It both parses and
generates. It currently includes a small toy lexicon, which is aimed to
be extended in the future via generation of lexical entries from a
morphological processor of Arabic.

The grammar will be available for download soon.

Here is a good introduction to AraGram:

AraGram was developed based on [HeGram](https://delph-in.github.io/docs/grammars/HeGram), an HPSG grammar of
Modern Hebrew, and the two grammars are currently being developed in
parallel.
