{% raw %}# Background

At the [2013 DELPH-IN Summit](https://delph-in.github.io/docs/summits/SaarlandTop), the first day was opened by
a short ‘tutorial’ of key DELPH-IN ingredients—aiming to give a
high-level picture of the DELPH-IN ecosystem and introduce relevant
jargon for novices. The 2013 tutorial was presented by
EmilyBender and StephanOepen. Following
is an über-summary of the material presented (including that which we
didn't have time for, as well as further addenda after the fact):

- [Processing](https://delph-in.github.io/docs/howto/DelphinTutorial_Processing)
- [Grammars](https://delph-in.github.io/docs/howto/DelphinTutorial_Grammars)
- [Formalisms](https://delph-in.github.io/docs/howto/DelphinTutorial_Formalisms)
- [Distributions](https://delph-in.github.io/docs/howto/DelphinTutorial_Distributions)

Please give feedback (e.g. on remaining open questions, inaccuracies, or
omissions) to Emily and Stephan.

Another source of terms and definitions is the (more than mildly
out-of-date) [DelphinGlossary](https://delph-in.github.io/docs/summits/DelphinGlossary).
