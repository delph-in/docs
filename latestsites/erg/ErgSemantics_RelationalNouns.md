- Payne et al (2013, 804) point out that phrases like *Mary's former
mansion* present an interesting puzzle for semantic compositionality
in that there are two interpretations of *former*: the phrase can
either refer to something of Mary's that used to be a mansion or
(more commonly) to a mansion that used to be Mary's. In the latter
interpretation, *former* has to be predicated of the relation
holding between *Mary* and *mansion*, which in the ERG isn't
introduced by *Mary*.
