processed)
- all examples *italicized*
- specific predicate or role or variable property names in typewriter

# Fingerprints Conventions

- There is not any need to explicitly indicate the label of an EP if
that label is not identified with (or involved in a qeq with) any
other label.
- ARG1+ is an underspecification of ARG1, ARG2, ARG3, ARG4
- ARG0+ is an underspecification of ARG0, ARG1, ARG2, ARG3, ARG4
- When underspecified ARG positions appear, it is understood than in
any given EP description each ARG position mentioned describes a
different ARG value.
- ARG1\|2 or similar to underspecifications between just two
positions?
