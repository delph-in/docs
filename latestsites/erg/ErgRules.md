{% raw %}# ERG Lexical and Syntactic Rules

The grammar contains several types of rules, including inflectional and
derivational lexical rules, affixation rules for punctuation, and
syntactic constructions. Example analyses illustrating the use of these
rules from the Redwoods treebank can be found
[here.](http://compling.hss.ntu.edu.sg/ltdb/cgi/ERG_1214/rules.cgi)

## Names of rules

The names of the rules are assigned using the following three-field
template, with fields separated by an underscore:

|                   |             |           |
|-------------------|-------------|-----------|
| Daughter sequence | Annotations | Rule type |

The Daughter sequence field gives the sequence of one or two
constituents that comprise the sign, separated by a hyphen, using the
following abbreviations:

|      |                         |
|------|-------------------------|
| hd   | head                    |
| hdn  | nominal head            |
| nh   | non-head                |
| sb   | subject                 |
| sp   | specifier               |
| cmp  | complement              |
| aj   | adjunct                 |
| flr  | filler                  |
| mrk  | marker                  |
| np   | nominal phrase          |
| cl   | clause                  |
| vp   | verb phrase             |
| pp   | prepositional phrase    |
| n    | noun                    |
| v    | verb                    |
| j    | adjective               |
| r    | adverb                  |
| p    | preposition             |
| w    | word                    |
| num  | number                  |
| prdp | predicative phrase      |
| jpr  | predicative adj phrase  |
| vpr  | predicative verb phrase |
| ppr  | predicative prep phrase |
| mnp  | measure noun phrase     |
| pct  | punctuation mark        |

The Annotations field provides a brief sketch of the distinguishing
properties of the rule.

The Rule type distinguishes among the broad classes of rules, using the
following suffixes:

|        |                                  |
|--------|----------------------------------|
| \_ilr  | orth-invariant inflectional rule |
| \_olr  | orth-changing inflectional rule  |
| \_dlr  | orth-invariant derivational rule |
| \_odlr | orth-changing derivation rule    |
| \_plr  | punctuation affixation rule      |
| \_c    | syntactic construction           |

The table below contains an exhaustive inventory of the rules used in
the ERG (as of the 1214 release).
