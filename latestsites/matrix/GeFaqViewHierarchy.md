## How do I browse the type hierarchy?

You can browse the type hierarchy through the LKB:

- From the LKB main window, click on "View -&gt; Type hierarchy" and
enter the type's identifier.
- This will open up a window containing a subset of the type hierarchy
with the specified type and all its descendants.
- Note that if you are using a large resource grammar, viewing the
entire hierarchy may either be impractical and/or impossible and you
will need to look at specific subsets of the hierarchy.
