## A menu item seems to have disappeared (e.g., Parse &gt; Compare or Generate). How do I get it back?

When the LKB starts up, the LKB Top menu defaults to "Beginner" mode.
This mode is meant to present the more self-explanatory and/or better
documented features, while hiding the rest. If you want to see all of
the features available through the menu, select "Options &gt; Expand
Menu". To go back to the smaller menu, select "Options &gt; Shrink
Menu".
