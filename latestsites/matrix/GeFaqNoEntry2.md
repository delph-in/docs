{% raw %}# Grammar Engineering Frequently Asked Questions

## I have written my lexical rule in the grammar file, but it still isn't getting applied. What could be preventing it from being used?

It's possible that you've created a rule that doesn't add an affix yet
told the LKB that it's an inflecting rule (i.e., one that needs an
affix).

Also, see [this FAQ: I've added a rule to my grammar but the LKB doesn't
seem to have found it. What's happening?](https://delph-in.github.io/docs/matrix/GeFaqNoRule)
