## How do I get the LKB to tell me what type(s) a feature or set of features is appropriate for?

First, expand the LKB Top menu by selecting Options &gt; Expand Menu.
From the expanded menu, select Debug &gt; Find Features' Type. Enter the
list of features that you are interested in in the dialog box. For
example:

    (CAT CONT)
    (HC-LIGHT)

The LKB will find the maximal (most general) type, if any, for which all
of the features in the list are compatible.
