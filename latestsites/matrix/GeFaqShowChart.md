## How do I get the LKB to show me the parse chart?

If you have successfully parsed a sentence, one of the buttons at the
top of the window showing the parse(s) will be "Show chart".

If you have tried to parse a sentence but the LKB didn't find any
parses, you can still look at the chart by selecting "Parse &gt; Show
parse chart" from the LKB top menu.
