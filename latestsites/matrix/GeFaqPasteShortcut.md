## How do I paste into the LKB parse dialogue?

On Linux, the LKB dialogs that take textual input (e.g., the one reached
from View/Type definition...) treat keybindings like Ctrl-X and Ctrl-V
as just another character. Instead, to paste into them, use
Shift-Insert. Alternatively, after selecting the desired text using the
mouse cursor, you should be able to paste (from a separate clipboard)
using the middle button of your mouse.
