{% raw %}The WeSearch project is a four-year investigation into the application
of 'deep' semantic parsing technologies to user-generated content, with
a special focus on semi-automated parser adaptation to genre and domain
variation. The project is funded by the Norwegian Research Council
through its [VerdIKT](http::www.forskningsradet.no/verdikt) programme.

One of the early results released publicly by the project is the
*WeSearch Data Collection* (WDC), to be made available for download in
the summer of 2012. Please watch this page for updates or email
jread@ifi.uio.no if you would like to be notified when WDC is made
available.
