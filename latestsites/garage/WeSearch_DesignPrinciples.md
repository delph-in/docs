{% raw %}Design principles for DELPH-IN/MRS semantic representations identified
during the Hank√∏ meeting:

- Interface representation should include all information that is
constrained by the grammar
- Interface representation should be highly normalized, abstracting
away from details of surface syntax
- Close paraphrases should lead to comparable or identical structures
in the interface representation
  - Ex: Predicative copula does not contribute an EP (The fierce dog
barks \~ The dog that is fierce barks)
  - Ex: Dative alternation, passive (modulo discourse rel)
- Minimize ambiguity
  - Corollary: Differentiate lexical predicates only if that
distinction corresponds to morphosyntactic differences
- Decomposition is desirable, but not a goal in itself. If the
predicates required for decomposition exist, then it is good.
