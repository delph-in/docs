{% raw %}# Background

As people at NTT and the Kyoto University Open Laboratory (i.e. members
of the Hinoki project) start experimentation with the LOGON machine
translation infrastructure, it will likely be useful to accumulate
documentation and exchange knowledge in a piecemeal fashion. For the
time being, the LOGON technology has not been released publically
available, even though it will be unrestricted open-source. Thus, Hinoki
members act much like beta testers, and we will keep these pages private
for the time being.

# Schedule and Responsibilities

- LOGON access policy and mode of distribution (oe)
- MRS property mappings (oe)
- MT bach processing and BLEU scoring (intro: oe, use: fcb)
- SEM-I interactions (use of hierarchy, look up information, et al.)
- [JaEn](/JaEn), [EnJa](/EnJa), [NoJa](https://delph-in.github.io/docs/tools/NoJa), [JaNo](/JaNo) and
[JaJa](/JaJa) prototypes (oe & fcb)
- sharing types across transfer grammars (oe, testing fcb)
- draft documention [LogonTransfer](https://delph-in.github.io/docs/tools/LogonTransfer) (fcb, should really
be oe)

## Not strictly MT

- unknown words and numbers
- gold JaCY profiles in CVS DONE
- web demonstrator
