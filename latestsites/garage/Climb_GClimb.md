{% raw %}# gCLIMB: CLIMB for Germanic languages

## General

gCLIMB is a resource that can create DELPH-IN grammars for Germanic
languages. The development has focused on German, but it contains some
variations to cover Dutch and Danish. It is meant to provide a platform
to maintain alternative analyses in parallel and test their impact on
long-term grammar development. The system can also be used to start a
new grammar of a Germanic language and develop it the traditional way
from the output of the system.

**note:** This page is currently under construction and will slowly grow
towards a more comprehensive documentation. If you have specific
questions or request on implementations or documentation, please contact
