{% raw %}# Comparative Computational Semantics

In collaboration with Stanford University and the University of
Washington, the [WeSearch](https://delph-in.github.io/docs/garage/WeSearch) project at the University of Oslo
holds a three-day, by-invitation working meeting from November 13 to 15,
2014, in Berlin. The meeting will be hosted at [Arcotel
Velvet](http://www.arcotelhotels.com/en/velvet_hotel_berlin/), not far
away from [Bahnhof
Friedrichstraße](http://www.s-bahn-berlin.de/fahrplanundnetz/bahnhof/Friedrichstrasse/59),
which is easily accessible from both airports.

# Materials

Participants have been asked to prepare candidate analyses (or general,
high-level reflections) for a selection of some sixty [minimal
exemplars](http://svn.emmtee.net/trunk/uio/wesearch/ccs/berlin.txt),
instantiating ten broad semantic phenomena. The following
representations are currently available for comparison:

- [Abstract Meaning
Representation](http://svn.emmtee.net/trunk/uio/wesearch/ccs/amr/all.amr)
(AMR), with [background
notes](http://svn.emmtee.net/trunk/uio/wesearch/ccs/amr/notes.pdf);
- [Boxer Discourse Representation
Structures](http://svn.emmtee.net/trunk/uio/wesearch/ccs/drs) (DRS),
with [background
notes](http://svn.emmtee.net/trunk/uio/wesearch/ccs/drs/notes.pdf);
- [English Resource
Semantics](http://svn.emmtee.net/trunk/uio/wesearch/ccs/erg/mrs.pdf)
(ERS), with [background
notes](http://moin.delph-in.net/ErgSemantics/Ccs);
- [Prague Functional Generative
Descriptions](http://svn.emmtee.net/trunk/uio/wesearch/ccs/fgd/fgd.pdf)
(FGD), with
[documentation](http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/functional-generative-description)
- [Transfer-Based Flat
Semantics](http://svn.emmtee.net/trunk/uio/wesearch/ccs/xfr.txt)
(XFR), with in-line background notes

Alex Lascarides has contributed a set of [high-level
reflections](http://svn.emmtee.net/trunk/uio/wesearch/ccs/lascarides.pdf),
relating compositional sentence semantics and desiderata originating in
discourse-level analysis. There is still room for additional target
representations, reflections, or pointers to relevant literature.

# Schedule

The meeting starts at 10:00 (‘after breakfast’) on Thursday, November
13, and we will wrap up around 16:00 on Saturday, November 15. The plan
is to use the first session to ‘jump right in’, i.e. familiarize
ourselves with the various representations and discuss design choices
for a specific phenomenon, control relations (which we believe to be
relatively well-understood and comparatively uncontroversial).

Reflecting on this first joint calibration session, we plan on a brief
high-level discussion after lunch, to exchange views about, for example,
our specific goals in different approaches to meaning representation
(and composition), known or anticipated commonalities and differences,
notions of standing (or sentence) vs. occassion (or speaker) meaning,
the role of grammar, or which sub-tasks to differentiate in semantic
analysis (like, for example, predicate–argument analysis, sense
disambiguation, named entity classification, resolving scope
ambiguities, and coreference resolution).

To prepare for an afternoon coffee break, we will not let theoretical
arguments get out of hand and start discussing a second phenomenon in
that same session. From there on, the meeting agenda is largely up to
collective decision making, but we shall try to get through in-depth
discussion of at least six of the phenomena on our shopping list.

# Financial Support

The project has available funds by the Norwegian Research council to
cover (the bulk of) expenses related to participation in the meeting,
viz.

- travel costs, up to EUR 300 or EUR 800 for European or US
participants, respectively;
- up to four overnight stays at the conference hotel (not including
breakfast);
- lunches during the three days of the working meeting (Thursday to
Saturday);
- a joint dinner for all participants, on Friday evening (November
14).

Participants are asked to make their own travel arrangements and email
their arrival and departure times to StephanOepen, who
will make hotel reservations. Please keep receipts and (if applicable)
boarding passes, which you will have to submit for reimbursement to the
University of Oslo after completion of your travels. With a bit of luck,
reimbursements should be processed by mid-December.

To request reimbursement, UiO will need your date of birth, home
address, and [bank
information](http://www.uio.no/for-ansatte/skjema/opa/vedlegg-utland.odt).
In addition to the form, please mail receipt(s) for travel expenses to
the address below. In case of electronic tickets and receipts, please
include a boarding pass stub or similar, i.e. something that can be
interpreted as an ‘original’ document.
