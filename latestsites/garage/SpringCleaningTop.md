{% raw %}# Grammar Spring Cleaning

The Grammar Spring Cleaning algorithm goes through a grammar implemented
in TDL and removes types that do not have an impact on the competence of
the grammar. It is combined with a grammar compression algorithm,
implemented by Yi Zhang, that counts the minimum types needed to create
an equivalent grammar, where equivalent grammars refers to grammars that
return the same set of analyses for the same input string (which may be
the empty set).
