{% raw %}Extensional (provisional) definition of "phenomenon"

Things to look at:

- Grammarian generated lists
- CSLI test suite classification scheme
- TSNLP (too small)
- GOLD ontology

How many levels of classification?

use cases

- Cross-grammar comparison (difficult, requires defensible lists)
- Grammar exploration (more lenient) -- even just having the lists
will be interesting
- Constructing list of phenomena for phenomenon labels on constraints

One way to manage the granularity issue is to cap the number of
phenomena that can be listed.

"cover a phenomenon": doesn't entail that you cover everything about it
(disclaimer at the top)

Task:

- Each grammar can do up to 100 phenomenon labels for this first step.
- Attempt to capture all that is interesting in those 100 phenomenon
labels rather than just going to 100 and stopping.
- Use non-language-specific terminology if possible; if reference to a
morpheme of the language is unavoidable, provide a one-sentence
explanation of the phenomenon.
  - Don't lump distinct phenomena into a single label based solely
on shared morphemes.
  - Include one-two examples sentences that illustrate the
phenomenon
    - If you have time, please provide translations into English
for the examples.
    - If you are enthusiastic, consider adding IGT.

Motivation:

Antske --- keeping track of what's in each release, giving organized
view of what's covered without having to go into detail (would make
dissertation too long), want it for other grammars.

Dan --- altruistic only; eventual possibility of tying these labels to
objects in the grammar would be interesting but we're not doing that
yet.

Getting it to happen:

Emily creates list for Wambaya and sends it around with invitation for
others to contribute/post same by some specific time. Use CSLI file from
Dan as inspiration and also send it along. Do this soon so that it
doesn't seem too big of a task. \[Make sure Wambaya demo is actually
running.\] Put on DELPH-IN wiki in a similar structure to the
[MatrixMrsTestSuite](https://delph-in.github.io/docs/grammars/MatrixMrsTestSuite) pages. Link from grammar
catalogue too.
