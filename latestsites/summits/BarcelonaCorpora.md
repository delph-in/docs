{% raw %}# Discussion: Parallel Corpora

# Moderator: Francis Bond, Antonio Branco; Scribe: Micha Jellinghaus

# Objective

- Actually start work on the Cathedral and the Bazaar
- Make sure we all agree on the format
- Other parallel texts
- Acquisition from parallel texts

# Notes

## The Cathedral and the Bazaar

Francis reports on [The Cathedral and the Bazaar](https://delph-in.github.io/docs/grammars/MatrixMrsCatb). This
corpus is available in a lot of languages, though some translations are
missing a few paragraphs because they were translated from ealier
versions. The texts should be converted to tsdb profiles. There are
important formatting guidelines for this on the mentioned wiki page.

Currently, the English profile is already distributed with the ERG. The
Japanese one is not yet available but will be soon. Francis encourages
others to make profiles for other languages.

Dan adds that The Cathedral and the Bazaar is one of the hardest texts
to parse due to its creative use of language. The initial coverage was
70 %, though during treebanking it became apparent that the correct
result was often not included. Others should not be discouraged by this,
though.

Rebecca asks about what domain The Cathedral and the Bazaar fits in. Dan
and Francis think it's Essay.

Emily: Does its difficulty (i.e. wide range of phenomena) make it a good
corpus? Dan: In that respect, yes. Otherwise no. Francis adds that It's
also good for showing off what your grammar can do and that it's also
one of the very few truly multilingual corpora there are.

## Other Parallel Corpora

Francisco expresses his concern that The Cathedral and the Bazaar is too
difficult for emerging grammars like the Portugues one and that It would
be good to also have some easier corpus. He suggests to take easy
Wikipedia articles and translate them to other languages.

Hans replies that one disadvantage of Wikipedia articles is that there
are no semantic chains of a certain type in this genre, e.g. very few
pronouns, or NP-to-NP coreferences.

Scott suggests to use the Universal Declaration of Human Rights or other
international documents, e.g. airport regulations, shipping regulations,
soccer rules etc.

Software documentation is also mentioned, though Francis objects that
these texts are often not good examples of a language because the genre
is just too weird.

Berthold says that for his work on Hausa, he is in contact with Deutsche
Welle who should also be willing to share their parallel data.

Emily suggests children's literature. They constitute an interesting
source of short sentences, though copyright might be a problem.
According to Francis, there are also open-source children's books,
though they are not always translated.

Francis repeats that there is a desire for more parallel corpora that
are freely redistributable. For other criteria what makes a good corpus,
see [FeforParCorp](https://delph-in.github.io/docs/summits/FeforParCorp).

## Suitable Wikipedia Articles

Stephan asks who would be prepared to translate some select Wikipedia
articles to their own language.

Francis: NICT has translated some Wikipedia articles about Kyoto tourism
that could be used. There exists also an extemely high-quality article
on Kendo.

Scott: The articles to work on would have to be brand-new articles.

Hans: There has been a very similar discussion on the EuroMatrix Plus
Project. The consensus there was that good articles are those on the
geography, history, and culture of a certain language community.

Francis proposes that we could translate completely independently from
existing Wikipedia articles in other languages.

Stephan suggests to start articles on deep linguistic processing and
translate those.

Francis: We could do that on the DELPH-IN Wiki instead.

A general discussion of Wikipedia etiquette ensues.

## Summary

Francis summarizes the discussion:

- Go ahead with The Cathedral and the Bazaar,
- tell us about other good corpora,
- put the corresponding information on the wiki.
