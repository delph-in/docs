-- Modus of participation of students in the meetings and the community

- \- students should take their own initiatives and create a student
DELPH-IN wiki page(s) - use the Washington grad students mailing
list for coming to contact with more students who use DELPH-IN
resources

-- The suggestion from Hans Uszkoreit is to have the next DELPH-IN
Summit in July 2008 in conjunction to [18th CIL](http://www.cil18.org)
(Seoul 2008)

-- The suggestion from Francis Bond is to have the next DELPH-IN Summit
in conjunction with HPSG 2008 in Kyoto

-- Other possible events that the Summit can be collocated with: COLING
2008 (18-22 August, Manchester), ACL 2008 (June 15-20, Ohio)

-- General question(s):

- -- should the event be collocated with other meetings? -- an idea is
maybe to have a shorter Summit and have some of the informal
discussions, that are now taking place during our 5-day Summit, take
place during the collocated event(s) -- should we have retreat-like
meetings like in Fefor or meetings organised in the heart of cities
like this year's summit?

Comments

-- EB:

- -- CIL 2008 is 7/21-7/26 (Seoul) -- HPSG 2008 is likely to be
7/28-7/29 (Keihana) -- Even if DELPH-IN is in Japan, that's pretty
close to Seoul.
