{% raw %}**Discussion III**

- ValiaKordoni : Announcement of subject **Questions**
:
- Integration of other research groups and systems
- Ways to approach them
- What can we get out of this effort.
- Basis and mutual commitments
- Expectations of the others
- Example for such collaboration:
[LOGON](http://www.emmtee.net/index.php?page=1&lang=en/)
- Visibility of [DELPH-IN](http://www.delph-in.net/)

This meeting is a preliminary stage. (In connection to the visibility)
People ask what [DELPH-IN](http://www.delph-in.net/) is. "Will I get
money out of it?"\
[DELPH-IN](http://www.delph-in.net/) started out of the efforts of
Stephan and others in the 90s. The consortium has developed by means of
the reactions and the interest expressed by people who have seen this
work. Shall we go on this way or take initiative as well?\
DanFlickinger 2 ways to negotiate:

1. If we need sth for our research within the DELPH-IN we can arrange
it by exchange of money or resources among the members.
2. If we need sth outside the group (e.g. Arabic grammar - morphology
components). Perhaps the suppliers won't ask for material, but will
have other motivations to provide what we need. We should see how we
can satisfy these requirements.

[AnneteFrank](/AnneteFrank): People who get funds for HPSG processing
should think about the possibility to have subcontracts to
[DELPH-IN](http://www.delph-in.net/) developers/contributors they are
related to (Note by Ann-Copestake)\
HansUszkoreit: Except for academics, everybody else
will need funding. 2 options.

1. You apply for your own funding but build up into the group (for
example University of Lisbon). Apply for money in your own country
using the name of the [DELPH-IN](http://www.delph-in.net/). Or:
Apply for a project in a certain area (e.g. hybrid M.T) and use
[DELPH-IN](http://www.delph-in.net/) resources and partners (for the
various languages of the project).Use
[DELPH-IN](http://www.delph-in.net/) as reference.
2. Projects like [DEEP THOUGHT](http://www.project-deepthought.net/):
We go out as a group and get sth together. Chances don't seem so bad
. International cooperation could bring more funding.

People have shown interest in the past when they here in conferences
about the work of DELPH-IN [AnneteFrank](/AnneteFrank): Clarification
question to ValiaKordoni: Did you ask whether we should
focus on the aims of DELPH-IN and see whom we should invite to join
us?\
ValiaKordoni: Confirms.\
StephanOepen: We should have some substance. How did
today's [DELPH-IN](http://www.delph-in.net/) come up. This cooperation
has helped us to produce sth larger than individual efforts. Grammar
engineering has been made efficient enough for real application. We want
to keep this tradition. We are scientists. As such we have certain
needs. PARGRAMM. They meet twice a year, discussing about their systems
… I wouldn‘t have anything against this model.\
HansUszkoreit: Scientists need resources, money, fund
etc. All this has already been the outcome of group initiative in
[DELPH-IN](http://www.delph-in.net/). Can we use it for creating sth we
don't have? (e.g literature)\
DanFlickinger: Current inventory of resources is not
sufficient. One useful outcome of this meeting could be to see which our
priorities are.\
[AnneteFrank](/AnneteFrank): We would probably move according to our
needs and won't hesitate to approach people that could satisfy those
needs. One area where this could arise is the interfaces between MRS and
RMRS for anything related to hybrid processing. The relation between
RMRS meetings and [DELPH-IN](http://www.delph-in.net/) meetings is not
clear yet.\
ValiaKordoni: We have very good amount of resources.
Availability and organization of our resources will encourage people to
collaborate with us. e.g. There are groups that could see how RMRS could
be used for their systems. It is a matter of better visibility.\
StephanOepen: In terms of approaching other groups: I
feel this is a pretty large group. There is no immediate need to
actively try to extend it. Others, should be able to see our work, and
if probably express their will to collaborate with us. We should be able
to discuss and compare other approaches from our field, but this doesn’t
imply we should…\
[LarsAhrenberg](/LarsAhrenberg): Ask ourselves how can our research
benefit society? Are there organisations that would be willing to fund
those aims of ours?\
HansUszkoreit: why we do what we do doesn’t have to be
known to he outside world. (For some people it is the only thing they
can do etc.). It should be very good though, to make clear to the world
how our research can be useful. DanFlickinger:
Especially if we want to get governmental funding.
