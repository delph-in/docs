{% raw %}The sixth [DELPH-IN](http://www.delph-in.net) Summit was held between
July 2 - 6, 2010 in Paris, France, immediately preceding HPSG 2010.

The HPSG organizers do not charge us for the local infrastructure, but
DELPH-IN participants who want to stay on for the HPSG conference (or
part of it) should register. For some days of the DELPH-IN Summit, we
have pre-ordered coffee breaks; to pay for these, there will be a fee of
approximately 25 Euros.

There will be a dinner on Saturday the 3rd at [Millesimes
62](http://millesimes62.com). The dinner costs 35 Euros (including
drinks). Please indicate on the participants page whether you are
attending, bringing additional guests, and would like vegetarian food.
