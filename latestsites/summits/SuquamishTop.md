{% raw %}The 2011 DELPH-IN Summit will take place June 25-29 at the [Clearwater
Resort](http://www.clearwatercasino.com/accommodations/amenities.html)
(and Casino) in Suquamish, WA, near Seattle. This is immediately
following [ACL 2011](http://www.acl2011.org/), in Portland, OR. This
Summit will be also mostly before, but slightly conflicting with [ICML
2011](http://www.icml-2011.org/) in Bellevue, WA.

registration fee covers meeting room rental, coffee breaks and lunch for
all five days, plus the excursion/banquet on June 26th. You can register

## Activities/Climate (what to bring)

[10 day weather forecast for Suquamish,
WA](http://www.weather.com/weather/tenday/USWA0440)

The Seattle area has been having an unusually cold spring, thanks to a
strong La Niña effect. It is not known yet but not unlikely that this
trend towards below-normal temperatures will continue through June. Our
normal average high temperature in June is 71 F (21 C) and our normal
average low is 53 F (11 C). It is not uncommon to have some light rain
in June. Please pack accordingly!

The planned excursion will include a boat ride (about 1:15 each way) as
well as some time for hiking on trails in a state park. Please bring an
extra (warm) layer for the boat ride and appropriate shoes.

The Clearwater Resort has a rocky beach --- pretty for walking, but not
meant for swimming (the water is cold year round). There is also an
indoor swimming pool and an outdoor hot tub.

## Transportation

The Clearwater Resort is reached by taking the ferry from Downtown
Seattle to Bainbridge Island. A shuttle from the resort meets most
ferries (during the casino's open hours). The ferry terminal is on the
water front in downtown Seattle. To get to Seattle from Portland, we
recommend Amtrak (yes, a train!). There is a 6:15 departure from
Portland (PDX) on 6/24, which arrives in Seattle (SEA) at 9:45pm, for
$50 one way, as well as earlier departures that same day. The train
station (King St station) in Seattle is about half a mile from the ferry
terminal (though it is not recommended to go on foot after dark). From
Sea-Tac airport, you can take Link Light Rail to downtown to catch the
ferry. Get off at the Pioneer Square station, which is again about half
a mile from the ferry terminal.
