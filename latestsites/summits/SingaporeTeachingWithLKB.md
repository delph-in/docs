{% raw %}Some points we discussed:

Let's collaborate and share our thoughts and experiences via the
participants list!

Provide students with USB drives with the setup

- Use a virtual machine

trollet as an alternative for emacs

Try to get students to come to class with laptops and go through
installation

- Need to have time to dedicate an entire section (or 2!)

Record demo for LKB

- Use [YouTube](/YouTube) Series of videos?
  
  - Whenever you learn something yourself, consider recording it

Motivate the long instructions

- Emphasize the step by step approach: do the homework as you are
reading the instructions

Problem: people are scared of command line and simplistic UI

- How to solve?..
