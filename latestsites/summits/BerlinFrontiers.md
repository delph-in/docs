Shared tasks and resources:

\- common benchmark for base coverage: parallel corpora treebanks for
the participating languages

\- shared tasks for HPSG processing: a. abstract processing exercises,
b. processing with respect to concrete applications

\- shared tasks for applications

\- cross-framework evaluations

Applications:

\- information management (relation extraction, incl. event and opinion
detection)

\- machine translation (in combination with other checking methods)

\- grammar checking (in combination with other checking methods)

\- dialogue systems (e.g., for web agents and computer games)

\- Others?

Steps towards applications:

HU: generation, exploitation of application semantics for getting to the
meaning of applications;

AC: we should work on resource semantics for different applications

Steps towards shared tasks and resources:

Shared corpora:

- -- Europarl -- parallel corpora based on touristic brochures,
guides, etc., which are already translated in many languages, but
which will also have to be translated to many more languages
  - AC: we should start with setting up the necessary machinery,
even with smaller treebanks, even of different kinds of texts
SO: a single coherent corpus DF: we collect the corpus by
picking up parts/sentences from different kinds of texts for the
various participating languages/grammars
    
    HU's proposed strategy to be adopted for the near future: a.
collect the languages which will participate, b. get the
people/sites who will be responsible for finding the corpus, c.
choose texts, which are not too highly marked stylistically and
have been translated to many other languages --&gt; city/region
descriptions, cathedral essay (on Francis' suggestion,
translated into all the languages we are working on, approx. 800
sentences), novels, linux/technical documentation,
everything, d. do the languages' matrix and see whether there
would still be gaps; Tasks: -- languages: en (Stanford/Oslo), no
(Trondheim), pt (Lisbon), es/ca (Barcelona), ja (Kyoto), de
(Saarbrücken), el (Saarbrücken/Athens), sw (Linköping), fr
(Toulouse), zh (Saarbrücken), ko (Seoul?); -- Saarbrücken builds
the Wiki page by the 1st of September; -- the groups mentioned
above submit the texts and translations to the Wiki page by mid
October, accompanying them, in a prose field, with short
description in order to know how the text in the various
translations correlate to each other; -- guidelines Wiki subpage
to be created by Oslo;
