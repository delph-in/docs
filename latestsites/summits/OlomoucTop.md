We will be on the second floor.

## Wifi at the venue

Access to `eduroam` is available. Palacký University belongs to the `eduroam` initiative and, therefore, enables users of any organization affiliated with the `eduroam` initiative to access its wireless network. The visiting user must use the eduroam `SSID`. Before coming and using the wireless network, we recommend that you check that your organization belongs to the eduroam initiative and that you have configured the service on your device.

We also have guest wifi for those with no eduroam.
