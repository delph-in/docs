The meeting will take place on campus.

## Wifi at the venue

Access to `eduroam` is available. Palacký University belongs to the `eduroam` initiative and, therefore, enables users of any organization affiliated with the `eduroam` initiative to access its wireless network. The visiting user must use the eduroam `SSID`. Before coming and using the wireless network, we recommend that you check that your organization belongs to the eduroam initiative and that you have configured the service on your device.
