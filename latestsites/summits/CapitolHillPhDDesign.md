{% raw %}EMB:

- FCB, SSH, and I have students working on projects, and we want those
projects to be good for their career; and have a clear path to
completion.
- I feel that just building a grammar without a research question
doesn't make a good PhD.
- OTOH, if the question is "what do you have to do build a grammar for
X" and the answer is a bunch of small analyses, that's also not
satisfying.
- Joshua, Glenn, and David are working on grammars; SSH did a library;
but Joshua's Negation library was not well-received by one committee
member.

Luis:

- We have people saying, why don't you parse 100%? where's the value

FCB:

- No, they're asking "why don't you handle discourse?" or some other
phenomenon
- We want the topic to be something that helps the student get a job
later.

EMB:

- We don't tell students what to do, but we tell them "this won't help
you in the job market"; maybe the student doesn't mind
- So what we do is choose 2 or 3 central phenomena, and build them in
a CLIMB-based approach (test different analyses); this focuses the
dissertation on one thing, but you can talk about how some analysis
affects overall coverage, etc.
- This isn't the only way, but it's what we've locally decided works
for grammar development

Glenn:

- Is it artificial to force students to explore alternate analyses if
they already know what they want?

EMB:

- It is somewhat artificial, but often we don't know what is the best
approach.
- Wambaya is one example where I asked "how could I do this
differently?"; while working on alternate analyses, I discovered
bugs, but instead of introducing those bugs into both analyses, I
forked the grammar in order to test it. Antske took the overall
process of testing multiple analyses and formalized it somewhat, so
that choosing alternatives is not bound by the order of development.

Luis:

- We are concered with the long-term health of the grammars, so if we
say "we want a Chinese grammar", we might ask students to tackle
certain phenomema, but they might disagree with previous analyses
for other parts of the grammar...

EMB:

- Another kind of thesis is a "grammar development methodology"
thesis.

Luis:

- How can one develop a grammar for one language without going for
coverage?

EMB:

- You can go for coverage, but you need to focus the dissertation on
one or several particular phenomena.

Glenn:

- Is it the case that these student grammars are left for dead after
the defense?

Luis:

- I think it's rare for grammars to be developed after the initial
work.

Glenn:

- Would a dissertation focused on one phenomena rather than overall
grammar coverage and health make that problem worse?

EMB:

- It seems to me you'd like students to come along and pick up
different phenomena. Even Dan says that certain parts of the ERG are
placeholder analyses. Why do you assume students can't come in a
pick up a different part of the grammar.

Luis:

- My point is, I see lots of grammars without very active development.
My guess is that it's hard to build a PhD on top of an existing
grammar.

EMB:

- I haven't had students come to me and say "I want to do a Japanese
phenomenon; can I work on Jacy?". I find that student come in with
different language interests, so they work on their own grammars.

ZZ:

- I've recently read Joanna(?)'s thesis; she focused on the BA
analysis (Mandarin). Of 300 pages in the thesis, 200 described the
phenomenon, only 60 described HPSG. From a linguistic point of view,
that is a very respectable body of work. But is it generally useful
for the Chinese grammar? Of course she needs more than BA. She
associated it well with other parts of the grammar, but those parts
need to be implemented also.

EMB:

- I'd like to think that if she did all that work, it would be clear
from the thesis.

Glenn:

- You need to anticipate that from the beginning. E.g., I need to do
some work on tools to support the development I want to do.

FCB:

- I'm not sure I agree with EMB that the Question is the only way.
There are multiple kinds of [PhDs](/PhDs). Building something of
lasting utility, etc.

EMB:

- Where's the narrative in that dissertation worth reading?

FCB:

- Few dissertations are worth reading...
- For ZZ we had lots of methodological things to solve; for David
(Moeljadi) we considered MT and integrating KBBI, etc.
- For the descriptive theses I advise, I haven't seen the Question
approach. There's a template of doing (a) phonology, (b) morphology,
(c...), and some students focus on one of those more than others
- We are making a new kind of linguistic description that wasn't
possible before.

Luis:

- There are subfields; you can look at the grammar as more
linguisticky or more computational. If you approach it as "this
looks like its fun to work on", when does it end?

FCB:

- 4 years

Luis:

- Where's the sense of accomplishment if after months of hard work you
parse 60% of the corpus?

FCB:

- (some book says) "there's only one kind of thesis, it must focus on
(some narrow subfield of linguistics), must be framed in this way,
..., otherwise it's nonsense."
- not everyone shares these views

Glenn:

- in addition to the thesis itself, our grammars are a useful artifact
of the process. Do we get credit for that?

EMB:

- no
- some people do descriptive work and get grammaticality judgments and
don't share that data; it's incomplete
- when you do theoretical syntax, it's pages of dense argumentation,
and a literature review where you're accountable to every point, and
what we're doing is different in that regard

ZZ:

- we can phrase it as "what are you contributing?"
- if it's "we are advancing understanding of BA", that's a good thesis
- if it's "we have a grammar that now covers X% of the corpus", people
might say "well others have done that (e.g. in LFG), so what's new
here?"

Glenn:

- None of us wonders if it's possible to complete a grammar (e.g. to
100%), so that's not a goal

FCB:

- Many theories of language are based on a small subset of languages,
so working on lesser known languages could have value in advancing
general understanding
- My thesis was a problem-solving thing. "How can we do better than
the state-of-the-art"? I said "if we introduce these phenomena
(countability, coreference, etc), we can improve results.."

Glenn:

- Our work falls into "engineering", and so it's not necessarily about
doing something novel so much as about building something

EMB:

- Science is about finding truth and engineering is about finding
solutions; either way you should generate new knowledge.

FCB:

- you need to generalize your findings

EMB:

- important Q: you claim to produce new knowledge; who is that
interesting to and why? Frame it so the value is obvious.
- if the knowledge we generate is completely locked in the artifact
(grammar or system), we have not done our job.

FCB:

- not everyone considers all ways (of doing a thesis) are as valid as
others; consider who's on your committee, your examineers, and your
hirers (potential employer)

EMB:

- and who you want it to be useful to later

Olga:

- and you need something that you will be comfortable with

EMB:

- what happens to the people who do pure-descriptive theses?

FCB:

- they go back to their home country and teach English, or linguistics
- they aren't necessarily the theses we're proudest of, but many of
these students come from home universities without a strong research
program
- but sometimes they uncover things that are typologically interesting
- everyone wants to redo the orthography first, though

Olga:

- the problem of wanting to redo things is a very old problem, even in
CS, it ends up costing more to rebuild rather than reuse

EMB:

- you need to spend your time on what's your novel contribution, so
don't waste time if redoing things doesn't advance your overall
progress
- redoing orthography because the existing one doesn't represent a
phonological distinction is important; but maybe it's not what you
want to focus on

FCB:

- there are some changes where you specialize
- some people aren't satisfied until they've rewritten some piece of
code into another (and another) programming language...
- there's disagreement on what a good PhD thesis is regarding novelty;
some think that the student must do \*everything\* on their own;
others are fine if you're in a team of 50 people on some bigger
problem and you're in charge of some small part of it.

David:

- I like grammar engineering for my thesis because my background is
linguistics, and I get to play with various phenomena in my
language, but also because the grammar produces results. I get to
see trees and semantics from the grammar I built.

Glenn:

- so you think you couldn't do all the linguistic work you want to do
without the computational approach?

David:

- well I like that it feels like language documentation but it works

FCB:

- 60% coverage was a stretch goal, but for a PhD you don't have to do
what you started out to do. You need something at the end, but it
could be very different from the original goal.
- btw, with robustness measures, we're probably close to 60%, so we
can hit that number of we really wanted to

EMB:

- yes, these things are negotiable, but must be negotiated. The
student shouldn't go off to their tower for 3 years without
communication with their committee.
- Martin Kay is an extreme example for coming back after many years
with some body of work and getting a PhD
- generally students need lots of updates and adjustments along the
course

Luis:

- Essentially the advisor says "it's your phd, I'm here, but good
luck."
- This is nice when doing something theoretical, because you need the
space to develop your theories (e.g. when they disagree with your
advisors' ideas)

EMB:

- Joshua and I have longstanding disagreements about how to represent
things in MRS
- I say "fine, but you have to say why you're doing things
differently; you can't just describe the difference"

Luis:

- You need to defer to your advisors; your advisor is not a peer. It's
in your interest to maintain a healthy relationship.

FCB:

- There are examples of disfunction between departments because of
strong differences of opinion...

EMB:

- Not all advisors understand their role and responsibility; there's
not a lot of training for how to be an advisor

FCB:

- let's return to "how do we design [PhDs](/PhDs) that contribute to
the field as a whole?"
- it ties in with "how can we build grammars?"

EMB:

- there's the question of "where can we publish?"
- the ERG is an example of something that's done a lot but not written
about much of it
- there are pieces that would not constitute a book, but would be
great articles, and this is generally true for other grammars
- there's a scale of linguistic understanding that we can only do with
a computer, and we shouldn't be shy about that

David:

- but if you write up an HPSG analysis of something, that's only of
interest to HPSG people

Glenn:

- but maybe our approach is required for the work we do, because of
that scale

EMB:

- no, and it's not worth putting that point in a paper, because then
you have to back it up

...

David:

- how many languages have enough resources to sustain grammar
development?

FCB:

- with a competent native speaker, all of them

EMB:

- but then you're doing the fieldwork and the grammar development, and
that's much harder, as David can attest

Luis:

- I've been in sad conversations (e.g. at QTLeap) about grammar
maintenance; e.g. I'm not sure it's ok to spin off Jacy for fear it
would upset Jacy's maintainers, etc.

FCB & EMB:

- we wouldn't be offended
