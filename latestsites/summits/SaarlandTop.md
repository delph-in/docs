## Aims of the Meeting

The purposes of this meeting are to:

## Activities/Climate

[Weather forecast for Sankt Wendel,
Saarland](http://www.weather.com/weather/tenday/Sankt+Wendel+GMXX0933:1:GM)

Following the Summit tradition, we plan on Wednesday afternoon a trip to
[Bostalsee](http://www.bostalsee.de/en/), the largest lake in Saarland
and now a locally popular recreation center, some 20km to the northwest
of Sankt Wendel. (The Google map satellite image shows an outdated
picture taken a few years ago when the lake was almost dried up. The
location has since been significantly reshaped. The Bing map's satellite
image is more up-to-date and appealing.) [Recreation Center
Bostalsee](http://www.bostalsee.de/en/leisure-centre-bostalsee/) offers
various activity options, including rental motor/peddle boats,
windsurfing, fishing (license required), cycling, access to lake beach &
swimming, or simply a relaxing 6.8km walk around the lake (mostly paved
roads). Please pack your equipments accordingly (walking shoes,
swimsuits, sunscreen, mosquito repellent, etc.). Public transportation
from the hotel to Bostalsee takes about 35 minutes, transferring just
once at the nearby town Türkismühle, where our banquet will start from
19:00 at [Schreiner's
Restaurant](http://schreiners-restaurant.de/index.html)
(Saarbrückerstr.34, 66625 Nohfelden, 200m from the Türkismühle train
station).

Getting there:

- From Sankt Wendel train station, take a regional train to
Türkismühle (10 min)
- From Türkismühle train station, take bus line R11 or 630 to station
Campingplatz, Bosen Nohfelden (15-20 min)
- From the lake to Türkismühle, the bus is NOT so frequent. The good
options is 18:03 - 18:22 (other options are 16:03 - 16:22, 20:03 -
20:22, and 21:03 - 21:22)
- From Türkismühle back to Sankt Wendel, the trains are fairly
frequent (twice each hour) and the last one is 00:26 - 00:37 (or
04:09 which is not recommended)
- Please use <http://www.saarfahrplan.de/> to find the timetable of
all the connections
