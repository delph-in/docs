{% raw %}The following is a list of participants registered for the [**2025 DELPH-IN Summit**](https://delph-in.github.io/docs/summits/AmsterdamTop), to be held at [Vrije Universiteit (VU) Amsterdam](https://vu.nl/en), in the Netherlands, during the week of July 7-11, 2025.  Any member of the DELPHIN organization is invited and is encouraged to register here.

Details about the banquet and excursion will follow.

We will try to keep costs as low as possible (taking into consideration that accommodation costs will be high). However, a registration fee will be needed for in-person participants. The registration would cover coffee/snacks during the day, excursion and banquet. Virtual participation is free.

**Registration Cost:**

| Type    | Tentative Price |
|---------|----------------:|
| General | 150 euros       |
| Student | 100 euros       |

**Note:** Registration will be collected **in cash** during the first day of the conference. 

Please register your planned participation by editing this table to indicate which dates you'll
