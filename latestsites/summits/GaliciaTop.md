{% raw %}# Overview

The 19th DELPH-IN [Summit](https://delph-in.github.io/docs/summits/SummitTop) took place on June 26-30 2023, in A Coruña, Galicia, Spain.

Info for the online participants can be found in the discussion area.

## Registration

Please register at the [2023 participants page](https://delph-in.github.io/docs/summits/GaliciaParticipants).  We will do our best to make it a hybrid event, please let us know if you intend to attend locally or virtually, and if so your preferred times (for meeting scheduling).

The event is generously sponsored by the [LyS Group](http://www.grupolys.org/lys_en.html). There will be no registration fee.

### Organization
The local organization is handled by Olga Zamaraeva and the [LyS Group](http://www.grupolys.org/lys_en.html) from Universidade da Coruña with the help of [Océano Azul](https://oceano-azul.es/). 

## Optional pre-summit workshop

A pre-summit [workshop on Lexical Resources](https://delph-in.github.io/docs/summits/GaliciaLexicalResources) was on Friday, June 23, led by Francis Bond.

# Program

The [summit program](https://github.com/delph-in/docs/wiki/GaliciaSchedule) is finalised. The program co-chairs this year are John Carroll and Petter Haugereid.

Note: We are adopting a "Spanish" schedule, starting at 10:00 or 10:30 and running till 19:00. This is mainly because restaurants here do not serve food until 20:30 and it would be unreasonable to expect that people will be going to bed early. This is similar to what was done in [Barcelona](https://delph-in.github.io/docs/summits/BarcelonaSchedule), our last summit in Spain in 2009.

# Location

The meeting will take place at the University's [Rectorate](https://goo.gl/maps/erV9Jsdfr3YUJ22f9), which is a nice building near the old town. The old town has some options food and drinks, with lots more options available in the newer city center, 15-20-minute walk from the venue. Coffee and lunch will be served on site on all 5 days. We will mainly be in [Sala del Consello de Goberno](https://www.udc.es/es/goberno/equipo_reitoral/xerencia/servizos/control-interno/inventario-e-patrimonio/patrimonio/sala_consello_goberno/), and on Thursday and Friday we will also have [Sala de Xuntas](https://www.udc.es/es/goberno/equipo_reitoral/xerencia/servizos/control-interno/inventario-e-patrimonio/patrimonio/sala_xuntas/) (same building), for some of the SIGs. (On Wednesday, we will not have the Sala del Consello de Goberno because it will be used to host a meeting of precisely the Consello de Goberno, so we will use Sala de Xuntas on Wednesday morning as well).

## Wifi at the venue

Access to `eduroam` is available. The Universidade da Coruña belongs to the `eduroam` initiative and, therefore, enables users of any organization affiliated with the `eduroam` initiative to access its wireless network. The visiting user must use the eduroam `SSID`. The wireless network of the University of Corunna uses the following authentication and encryption protocols: `802.1X, EAP-TTLS, WPA2-AES`. Before coming and using the wireless network, we recommend that you check that your organization belongs to the eduroam initiative and that you have configured the service on your device.

If you do not have access to `eduroam`, you can connect through the `udceventos` network

Instructions:

Connect from the device to the wifi network `udceventos`.
Open a web browser, go to any page on the Internet. At that time, a redirection to the authentication portal occurs. In this step, the browser will probably show a warning indicating that browsing is not secure. This warning must be ignored, otherwise the process will not continue.
Select the preferred identity provider (Google, Facebook, Twitter or LinkedIn). You will be redirected to the provider’s authentication portal. Follow their directions.

# Travel

A Coruña has a local airport (LCG) which services mostly Madrid and Barcelona but also a couple of international destinations such as London, Geneva, and Milan, though the latter flights don't fly every day. (There used to be a similar flight to Paris but sadly it seems like it is now gone.) This airport is nice and small, you can get in and out very quickly, and it is only a 30-minute bus ride from the city center. [The bus A4](https://moovitapp.com/index/es/transporte_p%C3%BAblico-line-A4-A_Coruna-2580-2414255-89827827-0) is very near the airport exit  (very easy to find) and costs 1.20 euros. (The only other bus that stops there is D4; don't take that one as it doesn't go to the center.) Alternatively, a taxi will cost you around 20 euros. If you find a convenient enough flight that arrives to LCG, this is the best option. (I personally always fly through Madrid and it is convenient enough given the short last leg and how easy/close to the center the LCG airport is.)

The nearby Santiago de Compostela airport (SCQ) services more international destinations. Santiago is only 28 minutes by train from A Coruña, though you will of course need to get to the train station from the Santiago airport. A taxi is recommended in this case, as the bus (number 6A) can take up to 50 minutes (for no good reason). The taxi is going to cost 22 euros. The train from Santiago to Coruña can be 8-15 euros, depending on time of day etc. Alternatively, there is a shuttle that goes from A Coruña to the Santiago airport directly (leaving from Coruña's [Bus Station](https://goo.gl/maps/tJbnY84f2UrrjcYSA)) but it only leaves twice a day, at 6 AM and at 12 PM, and I am not sure about the other way  (I will try to find out).

Another good option in some cases is the Porto (OPO) airport followed by a comfortable and cheap (7-10 euros) 4.5-hour bus ride (the bus leaves right from the airport and arrives to the [Bus Station](https://goo.gl/maps/tJbnY84f2UrrjcYSA); you can reserve the tickets [here](https://www.flixbus.co.uk/bus-routes/la-coruna-francisco-sa-carneiro-airport?_sp=6e992dd4-0fc4-4245-bcf4-1449a59d8e50.1668436920254&atb_pdid=a70b0321-e1c6-4117-ae2e-57016513c5a4&_ga=2.13750711.185378826.1668436886-1227310309.1668436886)). If you have a direct flight to Porto, this is a great option, as it doesn't involve traveling between airports and train stations. 

From Madrid, you also have an option of taking a high-speed train which leaves from the Chamartin train station and takes 3.5 hours to arrive to A Coruña. The Chamartin station is accessible by subway (including from the airport which is directly connected to the subway). This train can cost 60-80 euros.

# Accommodations

Two hotels will be holding some rooms for us until June 15:

- [HOTEL NH COLLECTION A CORUÑA FINISTERRE](https://www.nh-hotels.com/hotel/nh-collection-a-coruna-finisterre?campid=8435708&gclid=CjwKCAiA_vKeBhAdEiwAFb_nrcX0lVhcOVaiQPhuToHFQ8lBiWX9kuvrGLM6LjtjVqOUn46L7Qq86RoC_TQQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds): When booking the room you must indicate "group 110950001" (best done via email). This is the more luxurious option, only a few minutes from the venue, which includes access to outdoor saltwater swimming pools, for example. Breakfast included. 
- [HOTEL MAYCAR](https://www.hotelmaycar.com/): This 2-star hotel seems to have rooms. I am trying to get us a group discount and will update this when I can. This is an affordable, hostel-style option, a bit further away from the venue but still walking distance. No breakfast but there are cafes nearby.
- [HOSTAL LA PROVINCIANA](http://www.laprovinciana.net/): UPDATE: This hotel has been unresponsive, and on other occasion said they are fully booked, despite promising to hold rooms for us. I will leave the original info here but I no longer recommend to use it. Original info: When booking the room you must indicate the name of the meeting "Delph-In". This is an affordable, hostel-style option, a bit further away from the venue but still walking distance. No breakfast.

Otherwise, as usual, I am sure some people will choose AirBnB options or other alternatives. Note that there are very few hotels in the Old Town (where the venue is), but that the Old Town is only 10-20 minutes away from the City Center, where you will find numerous options.

NB: Spain is a loud country, and people here do not go to bed early and spend a lot of time out. If your AirBnB or hotel faces a street with bars (which is the case for La Provinciana, I believe), be prepared for loud noise until 3-4 AM during weekends (and sometimes until 1AM or so during the week as well). Many buildings have good windows but bring earplugs nonetheless. 

# Social Activities

Social activities will include a conference dinner, an excursion, and hopefully ample casual dining out in the evenings (see [the Local Guide](https://github.com/delph-in/docs/wiki/GaliciaLocalGuide)). A night of karaoke is also a possibility, though karaoke here opens quite late (11 PM), and so that would probably have to happen on Friday the 30th. Please plan your departure accordingly. 

## Pre-summit San Juan party

The San Juan party is the biggest holiday in A Coruña, when the whole town is out for the whole night, particularly on the (huge) beach, [hanging out around bonfires](https://www.spain.info/es/agenda/hogueras-san-juan-a-coruna/) and grilling sardines. It's very impressive. It is on June 23, and in 2023, this means the Friday before the summit. Some of us will try to be there before the summit in order to see the party, or maybe even to have our own bonfire (though that is easier said than done, as some people camp overnight to secure a spot). In any case, the party is worth seeing, so consider coming early if you can!
