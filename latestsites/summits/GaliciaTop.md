{% raw %}# Overview

The 19th DELPH-IN [Summit](https://delph-in.github.io/docs/summits/SummitTop) will take place on June 26--30 2023 in A Coruña, Galicia, Spain.

## Registration

Please register at the [2023 participants page](https://delph-in.github.io/docs/summits/GaliciaParticipants).  We will do our best to make it a hybrid event, please let us know if you intend to attend locally or virtually, and if so your preferred times (for meeting scheduling).

There may be a registration fee (especially if we will end up having coffee and lunches on site); I will try to keep it small.

### Organization
The local organization is handled by Olga Zamaraeva and the [LyS Group](http://www.grupolys.org/lys_en.html) from Universidade da Coruña. To contact the local organizers, you can use: congreso.delphin2023@udc.es

## Optional pre-summit workshop

A pre-summit [workshop on Lexical Resources](https://delph-in.github.io/docs/summits/GaliciaLexicalResources) is going to be on Friday, June 23, followed by the [San Juan party](https://www.spain.info/es/agenda/hogueras-san-juan-a-coruna/). 

# Program

TBA

The program committee this year consists of TBA.

Note: We will adopt a "Spanish" schedule, starting at 10-10:30 AM and running till 19-19:30. This is mainly because restaurants here do not serve food until 20:30 and it would be unreasonable to expect that people will be going to bed early. It will be similar to what was done in [Barcelona](https://delph-in.github.io/docs/summits/BarcelonaSchedule).

# Location

The meeting will take place at the University's [Rectorate](https://goo.gl/maps/erV9Jsdfr3YUJ22f9), which is a nice building near the old town. The old town has some options for coffee and lunch, with lots more options for dinner available in the newer city center, 15-20-minute walk from the venue. The details about coffee and lunch breaks are TBA. We will mainly be in [Sala del Consello de Goberno](https://www.udc.es/es/goberno/equipo_reitoral/xerencia/servizos/patrimonio_inventario/patrimonio/sala_consello_goberno/), and on Thursday and Friday we will also have Sala Xosé Portela (same building), for some of the SIGs.

# Travel

A Coruña has a local airport (LCG) which services mostly Madrid and Barcelona but also a couple of international destinations such as Paris and London, though the latter flights don't fly every day. (I understand that in the summer, there will also be a direct flight to/from Amsterdam as well as Geneva and Milan, and the ticket sales for these destinations should commence in February.) This airport is nice and small, you can get in and out very quickly, and it is only a 30-minute bus ride from the city center. [The bus A4](https://moovitapp.com/index/es/transporte_p%C3%BAblico-line-A4-A_Coruna-2580-2414255-89827827-0) is very near the airport exit  (very easy to find) and costs 1.20 euros. (The only other bus that stops there is D4; don't take that one as it doesn't go to the center.) Alternatively, a taxi will cost you around 20 euros. If you find a convenient enough flight that arrives to LCG, this is the best option.

The nearby Santiago de Compostela airport (SCQ) services more international destinations. Santiago is only 28 minutes by train from A Coruña, though you will of course need to get to the train station from the Santiago airport. A taxi is recommended in this case, as the bus can take up to 50 minutes (for no good reason). The taxi is going to cost 22 euros. The train from Santiago to Coruña can be 8-15 euros, depending on time of day etc. Alternatively, there is a shuttle that goes from A Coruña to the Santiago airport directly (leaving from Coruña's [Bus Station](https://goo.gl/maps/tJbnY84f2UrrjcYSA)) but it only leaves twice a day, at 6 AM and at 12 PM, and I am not sure about the other way  (I will try to find out).

Another good option in some cases is the Porto (OPO) airport followed by a comfortable and cheap (7-10 euros) 4.5-hour bus ride (the bus leaves right from the airport and arrives to the [Bus Station](https://goo.gl/maps/tJbnY84f2UrrjcYSA); you can reserve the tickets [here](https://www.flixbus.co.uk/bus-routes/la-coruna-francisco-sa-carneiro-airport?_sp=6e992dd4-0fc4-4245-bcf4-1449a59d8e50.1668436920254&atb_pdid=a70b0321-e1c6-4117-ae2e-57016513c5a4&_ga=2.13750711.185378826.1668436886-1227310309.1668436886)). If you have a direct flight to Porto, this is a great option, as it doesn't involve traveling between airports and train stations. 

From Madrid, you also have an option of taking a high-speed train which leaves from the Chamartin train station and takes 3.5 hours to arrive to A Coruña. The Chamartin station is accessible by subway (including from the airport which is directly connected to the subway). This train can cost 60-80 euros.

# Accommodations

Two hotels will be holding some rooms for us until DATE TBA:

- [HOTEL NH COLLECTION A CORUÑA FINISTERRE](https://www.nh-hotels.com/hotel/nh-collection-a-coruna-finisterre?campid=8435708&gclid=CjwKCAiA_vKeBhAdEiwAFb_nrcX0lVhcOVaiQPhuToHFQ8lBiWX9kuvrGLM6LjtjVqOUn46L7Qq86RoC_TQQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds): When booking the room you must indicate "group 110950001". This is the more luxurious option, only a few minutes from the venue, which includes access to outdoor saltwater swimming pools, for example. Breakfast included. 
- [HOSTAL LA PROVINCIANA](http://www.laprovinciana.net/): When booking the room you must indicate the name of the meeting "Deplh-In". This is an affordable, hostel-style option, a bit further away from the venue but still walking distance. No breakfast, but you don't need it due to the location! These guys may be a little bit slower with email, so you may need to call them. Please ask Olga if you need any assistance with them.

Otherwise, as usual, I am sure some people will choose AirBnB options or other alternatives. Note that there are very few hotels in the Old Town (where the venue is), but that the Old Town is only 10-20 minutes away from the City Center, where you will find numerous options.

NB: Spain is a loud country, and people here do not go to bed early and spend a lot of time out. If your AirBnB or hotel faces a street with bars (which is the case for La Provinciana, I believe), be prepared for loud noise until 3-4 AM during weekends (and sometimes until 1AM or so during the week as well). Many buildings have good windows but bring earplugs nonetheless. 

# Social Activities

Social activities will include a banquet, an excursion (details TBA), and hopefully ample casual dining out in the evenings (see [the Local Guide](https://github.com/delph-in/docs/wiki/GaliciaLocalGuide)). A night of karaoke is also a possibility, though karaoke here opens quite late (11 PM), and so that would probably have to happen on Friday the 30th. Please plan your departure accordingly. 

## Pre-summit San Juan party

The San Juan party is the biggest holiday in A Coruña, when the whole town is out for the whole night, particularly on the (huge) beach, [hanging out around bonfires](https://www.spain.info/es/agenda/hogueras-san-juan-a-coruna/) and grilling sardines. It's very impressive. It is on June 23, and in 2023, this means the Friday before the summit. Some of us will try to be there before the summit in order to see the party, or maybe even to have our own bonfire (though that is easier said than done, as some people camp overnight to secure a spot). In any case, the party is worth seeing, so consider coming early if you can!
