# Overview

The 12th DELPH-IN [Summit](https://delph-in.github.io/docs/summits/SummitTop) will be held at Stanford
University from Thursday, June 16, to Monday, June 20, 2016 (immediately
following NAACL in San Diego). The meeting will take place at the Center
for the Study of Language and Information (CSLI), in Cordura Hall. Our
first session will be on Thursday morning at 9:00, with the first two
and a half days organized as plenary sessions, and the last two days as
working group meetings, concluding mid-afternoon on Monday, the 20th.

# Program

The program schedule for the Summit is coming together on the
[StanfordSchedule](https://delph-in.github.io/docs/summits/StanfordSchedule) page, with thanks to the program
committee (Francis Bond and Stephan Oepen). The first session of the
summit starts at 9:00am on Thursday, June 16, with coffee, tea, and
rolls available in the courtyard starting at 8:30am. Lunches will be
provided in the courtyard every day of the summit, along with morning
and afternoon coffee/tea.

# What to Bring

The weather during the summit promises to be the usual ideal for our
summers, sunny and warm but not hot, so bring suitably light clothing.
If you're planning to spend any time up in San Francisco during your
visit, bring a warm jacket for the evenings there. Also bring a swimsuit
and suntan lotion for our Saturday afternoon excursion (see below).

# How to Get to CSLI

The summit will be held at the Center for the Study of Language and
Information (CSLI) located in Cordura Hall, in Room 100, which opens
onto the courtyard in front of the building. You can find it on the
campus map [here](https://campus-map.stanford.edu/?srch=cordura).

From the San Francisco airport, you can get to the Cardinal Hotel in
Palo Alto rather easily on public transportation. In the International
terminal, you will find the [BART](https://www.bart.gov) (Bay Area Rapid
Transit) train station, where you should buy a ticket to the Millbrae
Caltrain station (cost $4.40). During the week, there is not a direct
link, so you need to take BART to the San Bruno station (the first one
after leaving the airport), get off and cross the platform to catch the
train to Millbrae (also just one stop). At the Millbrae train station,
go upstairs, exit the BART gate, and buy a
[Caltrain](http://www.caltrain.com) ticket to Palo Alto (University
Avenue), for $3.75 (the cost for traveling one \`zone'). BART trains run
about every ten minutes, while Caltrain trains run at least once an
hour, and more frequently during morning and evening commute hours.

From the University Avenue Caltrain station, you can walk the four
blocks to the Cardinal Hotel. At that station, you can also hop on the
free Stanford campus bus (called the Marguerite) which will take you
close to CSLI. Take the "X" line from the bus stop on the
south-direction side of the station, and get off at the stop called
"[Y2E2](/Y2E2)", a five-minute walk from Cordura Hall.

If you are driving, you can get good advice from our nearby neighbor
Google on the best way to get to Cordura Hall. You can park in the large
\`C' parking lot across Campus Drive from Cordura Hall, and then come to
CSLI to pick up a parking permit for the day, which you will need to
hang in the window of your car.

# Excursion on Saturday, June 18

Immediately following the end of the session on Saturday afternoon at
3:00pm, you are invited for an excursion to pick apricots and then
lounge by the swimming pool at the home of Woodley Packard's parents in
nearby Los Altos Hills. Silicon Valley was once famed for its vast fruit
orchards, only a few of which remain, so it will be a rare delight to
enjoy apricots right from the trees. The pool will also be a welcome
treat. Transportation will be provided, returning us to CSLI in time for
the barbeque banquet at 6:30pm.

# Summer Barbeque Banquet

On Saturday evening, all are invited to a summer barbeque at CSLI, which
will include options both for vegetarians and for carnivores, starting
at 6:30pm.

# Housing

We have reserved a block of 30 rooms of three different types at the
venerable Cardinal Hotel in downtown Palo Alto for the five nights of
15-19 June 2016, at Stanford-discounted rates. You are urged to book
your room on the following event-specific website as soon as you know
your plans, since most of the housing alternatives in this area will be
much more expensive:
