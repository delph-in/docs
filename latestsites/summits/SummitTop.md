Since 2005, [DELPH-IN](http://wwww.delph-in.net) has held an annual
Summit. This is a loosely structured
[unconference](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference) where people
update each other about the work they are doing, seek feedback on
current work, and occasionally hammer out agreement on standards and
best practice.

We occasionally also have smaller more focused meetings between these
larger meetings.

## Planning Guidelines

### Physical Requirements

- One room that seats everyone, preferably set up for talks and
discussion;
- One or more other rooms for smaller meetings and breakout sessions;
- Good internet connectivity (there is a lot of live wikiing);
- Good microphone (Meeting Owl or similar) to pick up audio from in-person session for remote participants;
- In hot or sticky environments, air conditioning preferred;
- Access to nice coffee preferred.

### Timing

DELPH-IN Summits are normally held in summer, and are often co-located
with another conference (in the past, typically HPSG).

### Costs

In most years, there has been a participants fee, to cover local
infrastructure expenses, coffee breaks, and the like. We try to keep the
meetings cheap, to encourage student participation.

### Participation Policy

DELPH-IN Summit attendees can be:

- members of the 'participants' mailing list
- plus up to five nominated by local organizer
- ideally we should be able to have group discussions, hence about 30
people is a practical upper bound

### Program format

At the Kyoto meeting, we reflected on the format of the Summit, and
generally agreed on the following suggestions for future years:

- Three day core with a few days on either side (preferably
afterwards) for less formal time (with format varying depending on
whether the Summit is co-located with a conference)
- Split program chair and local host roles
- Local host can either manage virtual hosting or appoint a virtual
host for online participants
- Program chair solicit proposals for three categories:
presentations/updates, discussion, requests for tutorials, allowing
time for those agreeing to give tutorials to prepare ahead of the
Summit
- No parallel grammarian/developers sessions
- Internet access in the meeting room(s)

### Successful SIG scheduling

Some observations on making the scheduling of the SIGs go more smoothly:

- No individual should be responsible for more than N/2 SIGs, where N
is the number of SIG sessions they will be attending.
- If multiple SIGs are to be grouped into a single (serial) session,
this needs to be done before people indicate interest.
- SIG scheduler should lock the schedule page before beginning the
scheduling process.
