{% raw %}A [pre-summit](https://delph-in.github.io/docs/summits/GaliciaTop) workshop on lexical resources (including wordnets) will be held on June 23 (Friday) 2023 in A Coru√±a, Spain. Details TBA. Please indicate interest when [registering for the summit](https://delph-in.github.io/docs/summits/GaliciaParticipants).

The location of the workshop will be sent privately to those who indicated interest. The hours will be 10:00-14:00.

The workshop will be followed by a huge holiday night (San Juan). We will likely join a bonfire party of the local expat community.
