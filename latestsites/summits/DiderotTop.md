# Warming Up

On Sun 17, we are going to have a warming up in Belleville, including a
guided tour on street art (15 €) followed by drinks and food in the best
neighbourhood of Paris.

Meeting place: in front of the restaurant « Le président », metro
Belleville (lines 2 & 11). There'll be me, as well as our guide with a
sign « My Urban Experience ».

Anyone interested in the street art excursion should quickly register on
<https://doodle.com/poll/nxxk2ct2vz65t7hz> Price is 15€ per person.

Dinner will be at « Le lieu dit », 6 rue Sorbier (20e), just off rue de
Ménilmontant. Closest Metros are Ménilmontant (line 2) and Gambetta
(line 3 and 3bis).

# Accomodation

For reasons unclear to me (I come here to work), Paris is a tourist
destination almost all year round. The 13th and neighbouring 12th and
14th are probably less touristy than other arrondissements, e.g. the 5th
(Quartier latin) or 6th (St Germain). The 11th and 20th are not far
either and should be affordable as well. In order to choose a place to
stay, best have a look at metro connections first. M° 14 is probably the
fastest metro, so if you stay anywhere on that line you should be able
to get to the summit quickly.

Here is a list of affordable hotels (last updated in 2012) that are not
too far from the venue. I shall also see if we can pre-reserve a number
of rooms in one of the nearby hotels.

# Travel

## To Paris

### By air

Paris is served by two international airports, Roissy (CDG) in the North
and Orly (ORY) in the South.

**Roissy (Aéroport Charles de Gaulle) to central Paris**

The best way to travel into Paris from Roissy is by RER B. There are
stations at Terminal 1 and 2. If you arrive at Terminal 3, you can
easily walk over to the RER at Terminal 1. Travel time to Châtelet is
about 40min. The ticket is valid for any connecting metro or RER within
Paris.

There are also bus services to Opéra, Gare du Nord/Gare de l'Est and
Nation. For details, see
<https://www.ratp.fr/en/plans-lignes/acces-aeroports>

Taxis from the airports to Paris have a flat rate
(<https://www.g7.fr/en/paris-taxi-fares>). Official taxis can be found
at the taxi rank outside the terminals and are recognisable by the sign
TAXI Parisien on the roof. Do avoid any offers by unofficial "taxi
drivers" who may approach you in the terminal building or near the
exits.

**Orly to Paris**

For Orly, there are several options: the easiest is to take the Orlybus
to M°/RER Denfert-Rochereau. Alternatively you can take the Orlyval
shuttle to Antony and carry on by RER B, or else (Orly Sud only) you may
take Tram 7 to Villejuif Louis Aragon, where you can transfer to M° 7.

Taxis from the airports to Paris have a flat rate
(<https://www.g7.fr/en/paris-taxi-fares>). Official taxis can be found
at the taxi rank outside the terminals and are recognisable by the sign
TAXI Parisien on the roof. Do avoid any offers by unofficial "taxi
drivers" who may approach you in the terminal building or near the
exits.

### By rail

Different directions are served by different train stations. Travels
from/to the UK, Belgium, the Netherlands and Northern Germany
arrive/depart at Gare du Nord, those from the South of Germany at nearby
Gare de l'Est.

## To Campus Rive Gauche (U Chicago Center and U Paris Diderot)

Our campus is located in the 13th arrondissement fo Paris, close to the
Seine and the Boulevard périphérique.

During the first three days we shall be at the University of Chicago
Center in Paris (6 rue Thomas Mann), right opposite the Paris Diderot
main building.

You can get there using the following public transport:

- M° 14/RER C Bibliothèque François Mitterand
- Tram 3b Avenue de France
- M° 6 Quai de la Gare (15min on foot along the river)
- Several bus lines (Porte de France/Bibliothèque François Mitterand)

For bus, metro, tram and inner-city RER you can use the same tickets.
Best buy them in batches of 10 (carnet). You can take as many
connections between metro lines within Paris on a single ticket, but you
need a new ticket if you change between metro/rer or bus or tram. See
<http://www.ratp.fr> for connections and schedules.

Paris also has an excellent bike hire service Velib, run by the city,
which offers a seven day pass for 15 EUR
(<https://www.velib-metropole.fr/en_GB/offers/pass>) that permits to
take out 5 bikes simultaneously.To find available bikes and drop offs
you will need a smartphone app.

# Coffee breaks and lunches

Coffee and viennoiseries will kindly be provided by the U Chicago Center
on the first three days (a great many thanks again to Sébastien Greppo).
On Thu and Fri, our lab will provide for the coffee breaks.

There is a good selection of restaurants in walking distance of the
venue. Therefore, there will be no lunch offered on site, but on the
upside, there will be no registration fee either.

# Schedule

The meeting will be divided (as is customary) in three days of plenary
sessions (at U Chicago Center Paris) and two days of parallel,
smaller-group sessions (location to be determined). The programme will
be constructed collectively using the [DiderotSchedule](https://delph-in.github.io/docs/summits/DiderotSchedule)
page. John Carroll and Stephan Oepen serve as the programme chairs for
the 2018 Summit.
