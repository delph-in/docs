{% raw %}# Discussion: Modes of Cooperation

Moderator: Montserrat Marimon; Scribe: Bart Cramer

# Notes

Montse: Cross-site co-operation will make the consortium more visible.
How to achieve this?

S: [DeepThought](/DeepThought) project was the last project, in which
Delph-in was really cooperating between different sites.

Dan: Shared task seems a productive way to promote co-operation. TO make
this X-linguistically, Francis offers Japanese documents, comparable to
ACL anthology. Information retrieval might be a suitable task to join.

Francis sees the shared SVN repository as a good way of more
collaboration, and visibility of work.

People agree that more sending to mailing lists is useful, and that
shyness doesn't help. Is also a good information source for others.
Per-site DELPH-IN website is proposed. PET, Matrix and Jacy have bug
trackers. Things on Wikis seem not visible enough.

Hans: he sees the existence of projects (funded or unfunded) as a good
way to promote co-operation. Sometimes American groups can join European
funded initiatives. It is hard to get funding for DELPH-IN, given the
way we present ourselves externally (website! show more
results/achievements!).
