{% raw %}# MRS and RMRS

Joint discussion session including (some) grammarians and (some)
processing folk. Very roughly divided into topics that are more-or-less
grammar internal and those which are more related to the external use of
MRS/RMRS.

Scheduled for the afternoon of June 14th and morning of June 15th.
Participants should email AnnCopestake before making
major changes but feel free to make minor additions. People identified
are possible discussion leaders (in most cases, these are the people who
suggested a topic). Topics may start with a short presentation, but
please let AnnCopestake know if substantial presentation
time is required (more than 10-15 minutes). Please let
AnnCopestake know of any missing topics. Note that this
schedule is quite packed.
