{% raw %}The following is a list of participants registered for the [**2022 DELPH-IN Summit**](https://github.com/delph-in/docs/wiki/FairhavenTop), to be held in Fairhaven, Washington (USA) during the week of July 18-22, 2022. 

Any member of the DELPHIN organization is invited and is encouraged to register here.

Please register your planned participation by editing this table to indicate which dates you'll
be attending, your mode of participation (i.e. Virtual or In-Person) and, if virtual, during which hours on those dates you can attend.
The in-person program will likely happen between 13:00 and 22:00 UTC (9:00 and 18:00 in Fairhaven). 

Please add times **in UTC**:

We will try to accommodate the program around participants' schedules/restrictions as much as possible (e.g., hold plenary sessions between 14:00-17:00 UTC, repeating important sessions if there is enough virtual demand, etc).
