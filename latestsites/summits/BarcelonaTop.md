## Aims of the Meeting

The purposes of this meeting are to:

- update each other on recent developments and current activities;
- discuss more what we actually expect from DELPH-IN (and each other);
- create the opportunity for contentful exchange on computational
grammar research in the DELPH-IN spirit.
