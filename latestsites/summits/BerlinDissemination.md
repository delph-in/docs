### Tools for Online Demos

- Intro by LH:
  - online presentation of grammars to outside world and among
grammar writers
  - selected demo sentences showing coverage of grammar, specific
phenomena
  - display "small" feature structures with interesting part of
parse result, e.g. details interesting to MT/IE
  - morphology, syntax, semantics
- Discussion on motivation:
  - Oe: market to community, have more semantics, but show less?
  - BC: online demos important for internal, development purposes
(show co-developers changes, progress on specific phenomena)
  - VK: online demos are also important for teaching
  - DF: show simplified, flattened result, tools exist, partly
grammar-specific
- Discussion on filtering and displaying specific parts of parse
result differently
  - BC: parse selection not shown in LKB interface
  - AC/DF/Oe: showing treebanked parse selection is possible
  - US/BC: ERG+GG online demo only displays tree + MRS
  - AC: [XSLT](http://www.w3c.org/TR/xslt) is not for linguists,
computer scientist necessary in addition
  - SD/RB: useful generic tree transformation language
  - Oe, LH: LKB avm button greyed out, configurable filtering
important, but is end-user or grammar-writer specific
  - AC: display sub-FS under paths
  - AC/LH/Oe: not only hiding/showing sub-FSes, but also displaying
differently
  - Oe: XSLT stylesheets to display in browser (HTML)
  - AC: TFS DTD, ISO could be implemented in LKB
  - US: applet in Heart of Gold, TFS DTD in documentation
  - Oe: what tools do exist?
    - [LKB](https://delph-in.github.io/docs/tools/LkbTop) (X11)
    - [MoriV](http://www-tsujii.is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/moriv/)
    - [ERG online demo](http://erg.emmtee.net/)
    - [SProUTput
applet](http://www.dfki.de/~uschaefer/delph-in/sproutputapplet)
    - ... ?

### Modes of cooperation

- HU: Common applications
  - groups that are interested in / working on information
management, information extraction, event and relation
extraction: Tokyo, Cambridge, Saarbrücken, Oslo, Melbourne
- AC: paraphrase task (as proposed in the session before): interesting
task with nice properties:
  - take existing machinery to showcase (using parser + generator +
some simple idioms)
  - types of phenomena in paraphrasing (example): light verbs
  - demo system: type in sentences, let system paraphrase, let
people judge whether OK or not to get training data
  - set as common task?
  - information extraction in chemistry/medical domain is too
special as common task
- HU: currently event/relation detection corpus-based
  - if with deep processing: make sure that it works with
paraphrasing
  - paraphrasing as support for MT
- AC: learning paraphrase is learning semantic equivalences
  - also in grammar, style checking
  - JC: text to text paraphrasing, summarization, compression as
generic applications, maybe too generic?
  - AC: rewrite rules; learn or hand-write
  - HU: semantic entailment is also related
- HU, AC: DELPH-IN as forum for seeing which groups are interested
  - learn about preferences of the groups (e.g. dialogue)
  - interest in dialogue, question answering: Lisbon, Saarbrücken,
Trondheim
  - Oe: research interest (also) depends on funding opportunities
- Discussion on funding for DELPH-IN members
  - Oe: getting funding depends on whether application-oriented or
scientific vision
  - HU: DELPH-IN as a whole did not and (because of missing formal
frame) can not get funding (compared to ACE, CLEF), but groups
individually got funding with the help of DELPH-IN in
background, e.g. Lisbon (national, twice), Saarbrücken (PIRE)
  - gain reputation and credibility
  - bilateral grants (e.g. NSF, BMBF, ...) possible for DELPH-IN
partners
  - AC: what could DELPH-IN do specifically to help people get
funding?

### Dissemination

- HU: various ways of dissemination to increase DELPH-IN visibility
  - common evaluation tasks
  - connection with both large companies and SMEs
  - visibility at international conferences (thank DELPH-IN in
papers)
- Discussion on [DELPH-IN web page](http://www.delph-in.net)
  
  - mention DELPH-IN on homepage of members
  - automatically gather DELPH-IN-related bibliography data from
member web pages?
  - official maintainer of DELPH-IN web page?
  - Oe: facelift, content management system?, distributed
responsibility?
  - Google visibility: PARGRAM vs. DELPH-IN
  - web page: color scheme, content, news, publications
  - cf. Fefor 2006 discussion ...
