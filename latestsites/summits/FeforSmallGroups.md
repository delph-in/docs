{% raw %}# Small group activities

Much of what we might accomplish at Fefor will be best done in small
groups. The three broad distinctions made below are not meant to be hard
and fast, but are intended to help to achieve concrete results. In all
cases, leaders are named (if leaders have been specified
inappropriately, please let AnnCopestake know as soon as
possible). Other people who may wish to volunteer to lead an activity
are asked to add themselves and to email AnnCopestake as
soon as possible.

## Working groups

The aim of a working group is to get something working! Working groups
are intended for topics that involve a small group that needs to sort
out something specific/technical. For instance: there's some tool that
the leader developed, the participants have an active interest in and
have used at a novice level, but they want it to get it to work on a new
grammar. Group leaders will sort out the topics and group composition
before Fefor (as far as possible). Scheduling is done by the group on an
ad-hoc basis. Leaders are asked to add a page to the wiki for their
groups. Groups will report back to the plenary session.

- LexDB: BenWaldron (objective to get more grammars
using the LexDB)
- web server: StephanOepen (suggested by
FrancisBond: objective is putting other grammars
online)
- deep/shallow integration via S(M)AF: BenWaldron and
[MontserratMarimon](/MontserratMarimon) and ??
- harmonization of grammars: DanFlickinger
- exploring a common descriptive classification of linguistic
phenomena: DanFlickinger
- LKB/PET compatibility issues: shared configuration, reducing and
documenting the globals: NTNU, FrancisBond (follow-up
from Jerez)

## Tours of resources

Short descriptions of particular resources for small groups. Possibly
including:

- DanFlickinger: Semantic test suite (for people who
haven't seen it, in advance of discussion in [FeforRmrs](https://delph-in.github.io/docs/summits/FeforRmrs))
- AnnCopestake: Algebra checking tool (for people who
haven't seen it, preferably in advance of discussion of algebra in
[FeforRmrs](https://delph-in.github.io/docs/summits/FeforRmrs))
- DanFlickinger: LUI (alternative user interface for
LKB)
- DanFlickinger: Generation - trigger rules,
debugging techniques, batch testing
- FrancisBond: Treebanking with Redwoods
- BenWaldron: Preprocessor usage (now supported in both
LKB and PET)

Also, if time permits, tours could be given of the resources listed
above under working groups or installation parties, for people who just
want a introduction.

## Installation parties

Leaders have expertise in some resource. The objective is to get the
particular resource running on participants' computers **AND** to
further document the instructions on the Wiki on an ongoing basis. That
is, if the participants feel they needed extra instructions for the
installation, they write detailed notes on the Wiki. We would like later
installers to try installation from the Wiki instructions alone while
still at Fefor so that if things go wrong they can get help easily and
then refine the wiki instructions. This is intended for situations less
complex than those to be addressed by working groups: the leaders should
believe they can get the software working relatively straightforwardly.

Leaders are asked to circulate info about hardware/software requirements
in advance (this may just take the form of an appropriate link below).
Participants may wish to sign up with leaders in advance of Fefor.
