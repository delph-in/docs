{% raw %}20100704 delph-in summit - matrix customization system overview - group
notes

This break-out used Mauritian Creole as a demonstration of filling out
the Matrix questionnaire

more explanation about determiner choices please it would be nice to
have diagnostic questions for every question in the questionnaire,
something like "are there quantifiers as determiners... and is there
anything that substitutes for those..."

more high-end (linguist oriented) explanation of the
\*effects/consequences\* of each choice you make i.e. in the auxiliary
type definition section

add a link to predicate naming conventions on delph-in wiki from the
questionnaire lexicon page.

explain convention of naming '\_pronoun\_n\_rel'

Laurie's idea: as you're typing the spelling of the lemma on the lexicon
page, it autocompletes i.e. \_foo\_n\_rel in the predicate field...
(despite the fact that generally we matrix grammars use the english...)

for Laurie: reminder to give the option of only a single 'form' (where
appropriate) if there's no finite distinction

determiners should immediately follow nouns on the lexicon page

test-by-gen crashes when deleting a first noun stem and then (re-)
adding it at the end -- the numbering probably got messed up.

does python have exception handling whereby you can install a top-level
exception handler to catch \*every\* purple screen and automatically
email the details to matrix-dev. (ask Glenn for details,
thai-language.com does this)

test-by-generation: explain limitations on the set of things that are
demonstrated by TBG, so you don't think it's your fault. e.g. A list of
what will \*not\* be demonstrated by TBG
