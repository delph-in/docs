{% raw %}The following is a list of participants registered for the [**2024 DELPH-IN Summit**](https://delph-in.github.io/docs/summits/OlomoucTop), to be held in Olomouc Czechia, during the week of July 1-5, 2024. 

* Please add if you are planning to come to the banquet and excursion (and if so how many people).\
If with kids, please add X+Y (for adults and kids).
* The excursion will be to [Helf코t칳n Castle](https://helfstyn.cz/en).  We will have a guided tour and then a couple of free hours to wander around (there are cafes and ice-cream)
* Please add your size for the T-shirt!  Dimensions [here](https://onlinecatalog.malfini.com/file/pdf/size_chart/129---product_size.pdf)
  * If you want additional T-shirts please note.  They will be around ~200~ 300 CZK.

Any member of the DELPHIN organization is invited and is encouraged to register here.

There will be a registration fee this year, payable in cash when you arrive.  We would prefer Czech Crowns but will also accept Euros.  The exchange rate is rough, but we needed an even number to make change easily.  Registration covers coffee/juice/snacks during the day, stand up/karaoke on Monday (but not drinks), Excursion on Wednesday, Banquet on Thursday, and one T-Shirt.   Virtual participation is free.  

| Type  | Czech Crowns | Euros |
|-------|------: | -----: |

| Student | 2,500 | 100 |
