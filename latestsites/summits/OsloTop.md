# Background

The 2017 DELPH-IN Summit will be hosted by StephanOepen
at the [University of
Oslo](http://www.mn.uio.no/ifi/english/about/getting-around/) from
Monday, August 7, to Friday, August 11, 2017. Following the ‘classic’
format for these meetings, the first three days (Monday through
Wednesday) will be organized as one plenary session, with updates from
DELPH-IN member sites, discussions, demonstrations, and more. The
[programme](https://delph-in.github.io/docs/summits/OsloSchedule) for these days will be constructed
collectively beforehand, with EmilyBender and
DanFlickinger acting as the 2017 Programme Chairs. The
final two days (Thursday and Friday) will be (even) more informal in
nature and provide opportunities for more specialized ‘sub-group’
discussions, typically with two parallel sessions and three to five
meeting slots spread out through the day.

We will be using the [OsloParticipants](https://delph-in.github.io/docs/summits/OsloParticipants) wiki page to
keep track of invitations and likely participation; please self-register
by editing that page, adding your arrival and departure days on the line
following your name.

# Travel

The main Oslo airport (OSL; called *Gardermoen* in Norwegian) is
connected to the city center by a twenty-some–minute ride on the
high-speed airport express train. The port of Oslo is also accessible by
sea, with daily connections to Gothenburg (Sweden), Copenhagen
(Denmark), and Kiel (Germany). The *Sandefjord* airport (TRF) is
somewhat mis-leadingly nicknamed ‘Oslo Torp’ by some low-cost airlines.
It is connected to the city of Oslo by a two-hour bus ride.
