{% raw %}# TDL formalism discussion

[Yi's slides](http://www.delph-in.net/2013/tdl.pdf)

### Open questions:

- Was the level of simplification correct?
- future extensions?
- Other uses? (other applications)

Glenn: model floating point numbers and integers

Ann: TDL syntax LKB Copestake 91, not Kreiger 95

oe: name our formalism DELPH-IN Typed Feature Structure (DTFS) Logic

Emily, Glenn, Ann: BNF in white book or appendix in green book

Woodley: what operations on floating points

Glenn: we lose precision differently between processors on POS
probabilities

Yi: in deependence, treat them as a special case in particular places in
FS

oe: not quite the original LKB formalism now: unique GLB requirement
eliminated (in specification); only LKB has defaults; PET et al. support
regular expressions, token mapping; etc.

Ann: logic hasn't changed, formalism may have

Yi: compatibility and extensionability

David: do you have URIs? (Yi: no) should you? for sharing code fragments

Woodley: do grammarians want disjunctions?

oe: we should have mechanism for conseratively changing as needed
