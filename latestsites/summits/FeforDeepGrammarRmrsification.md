{% raw %}As identified by the grammarian's group, the following phenomena cannot
be given well-formed MRSs compositionally.

- ERG: Kim can and should sing. 'Can' and 'should' each have a hole,
but 'sing' only has one handle. Rather have the conjoined event 'can
and should' related to the handle of 'sing' through an arg\_rel.
- [NorSource](/NorSource): John didn't catch and fry anything
- ?? Amerindian languages: This approach might give us a handle on
attaching syntactically independent modifiers of arguments (noun,
pronoun) incorporated into verbs.
