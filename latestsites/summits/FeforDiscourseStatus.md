{% raw %}Notes on discussion of representation of discourse status and separating
it from quantifier rels.

[Emily's slides](http://faculty.washington.edu/ebender/def_q_rel.pdf)

Lars and Dorothee's presentation on the treatment of definiteness in
[NorSource](/NorSource): We show how the morpho-syntactic encoding of
definiteness is treated in [NorSource](/NorSource). Semantically
[NorSource](/NorSource) treats definiteness through interlingua
relations accounting for deixis, discourse status and genericity.

Everyone seemed convinced that it was worthwhile to unpack definiteness
(also demonstratives, other indications of discourse status) from the
quantifier rels and into features, most likely features of indices. As
part of this, we would expect a fairly flat hierarchy of quantifier
relation types.

We spent some time wondering about whether putting the information on
indices would in fact cause problems. One potential case was:

- In a language like Greek or Hebrew with definiteness agreement on
adjectives (also Norwegian?)
- NP with both an adjectival modifier and a relative clause, where the
gap in the relative clause is also modified by an adjective (perhaps
as secondary predication).
- Agreement evident on both the upstairs and downstairs adjectives.

If it's possible to have differing agreement in the two places
(indefinite in one and definite in the other) \*and\* we still want to
identify the index of the gap with the head noun, then there's a
problem.

Berthold suggests that we might want to treat relative clauses as
anaphora anyway, i.e., not coindex. (This makes relative clause
extraposition more tractable, too.)

Open questions:

- What features are required for representing discourse status, how
'harmonized' can we get across languages?
- What should the inventory of quantifier relations be, and how
'harmonized' can it be across languages?
- How many contrasts among constructionally introduced quantifier
relations?

Emily might make a first attempt at adapting the proposal of Borthen and
Haugereid 2005 and including it in the Matrix.
