The language file for the ERG (trunk version) can be found
[here](https://github.com/AlexKuhnle/ShapeWorld/blob/master/shapeworld/realizers/dmrs/languages/english.json?raw=true).
Below an incomplete list of words and constructions which another
language would ideally provide. Note that not all of the entries are
required for every data generator.

[DMRS demo](http://chimpanzee.ling.washington.edu/demophin/erg/)

Attributes:

- shape, square, rectangle, triangle, pentagon, cross, circle,
semicircle, ellipse
- red, green, blue, yellow, magenta, cyan, white

Relations:

- left, right, above, below, behind, front
- leftmost, rightmost, topmost, lowest
- closer, farther, closest, farthest
- smaller, bigger, smallest, biggest
- darker, lighter, darkest, lightest

Quantifier (others possible here):

- existential (e.g., *"shape is green"*)
- a, two, three, four, five (semantics: &gt;=)
- exactly one/two/three/four/five (semantics: ==)
- the, both, the three, the four, the five (semantics: == and no
others)
- no, half, most, all

Constructions (incomplete):

- attribute to relation (e.g., *"square"* --&gt; *"is a square"*)

## Trouble Shooting

With Jacy we have issues that the generator expects \_pred\_x\_0\_rel
and the interface seems to strip off \_rel, and it distinguished between
strings and types.

Moving to semantic-interface-2016   := "../jacy.smi". fixes the
string/type issue, I don't know how to deal with the \_rel issue.
