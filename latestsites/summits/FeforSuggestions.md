{% raw %}Some suggestions for future organizers:

- Tighter chairing of sessions/communication with speakers ahead of
time to make sure time is left in each spot for discussion. Consider
30+10 format rather than 20+10.
- Consider reversing order: Days with many talks followed by days with
more room for small group activities. As time goes by we find the
things we want to talk about. Also don't want to pester someone
until you know what they've said in their talk (don't want to make
people repeat themselves).
- Mountain location/intensive retreat format was very enjoyable.
- Start planning of sessions sufficiently early, so that there is a
first draft ready when people have to start planning trips. This
also helps for people to argue for funding.
