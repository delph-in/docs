### Feedback needed

In order for the preliminary schedule below to get more substance and
become more specific, we would like to ask you to send us and the
standing committee as soon as possible now and not later than June 30,
2007, your preferences and suggestions on the following:

1\. topics that you'd like to see discussed at the summit;

2\. topics that you'd like to present at the summit;

3\. the type of your presentation: to be more specific, we are currently
thinking of including in the program (a) shorter status reports on the
research carried out in our various DELPH-IN participating institutions,
(b) longer detailed presentations on specialised DELPH-IN research
issues, and (c) demos of systems, tools, lingware and resources;

4\. your preference on tutorials; should we have a couple in this year's
summit, as well?

Please send proposals, queries and other mail relating to the Summit to
<mailto:kordoni@coli.uni-sb.de>

# Schedule (preliminary)

Below you will find the preliminary schedule for the meeting.

This schedule has been based on your feedback, your expressed interests,
the topics you have indicated that you would like to see presented and
discussed throughout the week, as well as the time restrictions you have
inserted on the [ParticipantsGroup](https://delph-in.github.io/docs/summits/ParticipantsGroup) for your presence
in Berlin. We tried to take all these into account.

Please, do check and indicate to me (<mailto:kordoni@coli.uni-sb.de>), till
Thursday, August 16, all mistakes, omissions, conflicts, problems, etc.,
that the schedule still contains.

NB: On the schedule of Thursday, August 23, and Friday, August 24, we
have included the topics that you have proposed for discussion during
the Summit. BUT the schedule for Thursday and Friday is still open to
re-adjustment on the basis of the talks we will be hearing from Monday
through Wednesday. We will have the chance to discuss the schedule of
the last 2 days and possible re-adjustments in the last pre-lunch
Wednesday slot (12:00-13:00).

NB2: Please, consider volunteering as scribes for the various discussion
sessions. It is really important that the discussions we will be having
in Berlin get documented for future reference and for enabling our
colleagues who are not going to be present in the Summit to follow the
latest developments and decisions.
