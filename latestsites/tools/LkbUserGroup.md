{% raw %}# History

The LKB was originally developed by AnnCopestake (as
part of the [ACQUILEX
project](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/Research/NL/acquilex)) at the
[University of Cambridge](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk). She continues to
work on the system, but in the mid- and late 1990s, the software was
substantially extended in terms of functionality and processing
efficiency by JohnCarroll, [RobMalouf](/RobMalouf) and
StephanOepen. Most of this work was performed under the
auspices of the [LinGO Laboratory](http://lingo.stanford.edu/) at
Stanford University. DanFlickinger, the main developer
of the LinGO [English Resource Grammar](http://www.delph-in.net/erg),
has had a great deal of influence on LKB system design. As part of the
EU [Deep-Thought](http://www.project-deepthought.net/) project,
BenWaldron became involved with LKB development
(specifically, he took over development of the lexical database; see the
[LkbLexDb](/LkbLexDb) page) and has since been an active contributor.
The current distribution also includes code by others, most notably
BerndKiefer, FrederikFouvry and
EmilyBender.

The LKB has a reasonably active user base with an estimated several
hundred installations world-wide. Part of the LKB source code is used as
a post-processor in the [PET](http://www.delph-in.net/pet) run-time
engine (used by several active projects) and for the creation of MRS
representations on top of the Xerox Linguistic Environment (XLE) in the
[LOGON](http://www.emmtee.net) machine translation effort. Accordingly,
there are a variety of channels that may be suited for communication
regarding LKB matters.

# Communication with (LKB) Developers

To report problems with the LKB software (or other LinGO resources) or
inquire about specific aspects of its use (including donations to the
development team), please use the email address lingo@delph-in.net. Use
this address rather than mailing to an individual. We will try to
respond to all messages eventually, but cannot guarantee to do so!

# Communication with Other (LKB) Users

The [LKB mailing list](http://lists.delph-in.net/mailman/listinfo/lkb)
is for messages directly related to the LKB grammar development
environment, including questions that other users might be able to
respond to, bug reports of general interest (please always copy to the
lingo email address), announcements of fixes, new releases etc. All LKB
users are encouraged to
[subscribe](http://lists.delph-in.net/mailman/listinfo/lkb). Note that
you cannot mail to the list without being a subscriber (of course you
can unsubscribe at any time). Messages may be held for moderation.
Anything you post to the list will be
[archived](http://lists.delph-in.net/archive/lkb/).

# Bug reporting

Before reporting a bug, please read the manual carefully (it may be a
feature ...). Then check [LkbFaq](https://delph-in.github.io/docs/tools/LkbFaq) to see if someone has raised
your problem already. If you are running a non-current version of the
LKB, you might like to upgrade to the latest version and see whether the
bug has been fixed. (You do not absolutely have to do this before
reporting a bug, but we do not provide patches for earlier versions, and
we will only try and debug problems that we can reproduce in the current
version.) If none of this answers your question, please send a
description of the problem to lingo@delph-in.net with as much detail as
possible and in particular giving a verbatim report of any error
messages. Make sure you mention whether you are running source or one of
the images and state the operating system. You may be asked to provide
sample grammars that illustrate the problem. Do not send bug reports to
any individual developer: at best they will be forwarded to the lingo
address, and at worst ignored.
