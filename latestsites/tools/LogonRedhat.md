{% raw %}# Background

Linux distributions differ, particularly so in the selection of tools
and libraries pre-installed in standard configurations. This page
provides Redhat-specific information related to installing and operating
the LOGON infrastructure (for general installation guidelines, please
see the [LogonInstallation](https://delph-in.github.io/docs/tools/LogonInstallation) page). The information on
this page is user-provided documentation. As you extend or revise the
page, please take care to spell out (a) the specific problem to be
addressed, including observable symptoms; (b) the exact platform (32- or
64-bit) and version of the distribution affected; and (c) the exact
procedure to be applied for fixing the problem.

# RHEL8

      dnf install libnsl glibc.i686
