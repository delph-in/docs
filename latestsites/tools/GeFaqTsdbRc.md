## How can I tell \[incr tsdb()\] to start with the directories for "home" and "skeletons" that I want each time?

Create a file called .tsdbrc in your home directory. (Your general home
directory, not your tsdb home directory.) In that file, put the
following two lines:

    (setf tsdb::*tsdb-home* "< tsdb home directory >") 
    (setf tsdb::*tsdb-skeleton-directory*  "< skeleton directory >")

... with the desired directories filled in. .tsdbrc is read whenever you
start up \[incr tsdb()\].

Note that if \*tsdb-skeleton-directory\* is not set to a legitimate
skeletons directory (with Index.lisp and Relations) \[incr tsdb()\] gets
unhappy, and can experience mysterious errors.
